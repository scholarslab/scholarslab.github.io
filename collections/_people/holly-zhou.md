Memory Maps, is a collaborative, ongoing installation that interrogates what it means to be human in a world that is increasingly shifting toward the machine.  A response to the explosion in popularity of large language models, particularly in how they consume and flatten work from artists and writers without proper attribution, Memory Maps imagines what an ethical, community-based technological system might look like, independent of artificial intelligence. The system invites the visitor to the installation to participate as a creator, both crediting them, and choreographing a continual conversation between the past and the future.
