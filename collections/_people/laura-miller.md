The Scholars' Lab supports a diverse community of digital scholars and scholarly makers across the University and beyond. As Head of Public Programs, my main goal is to foster and grow that community. I convene our [speaker events and workshops](http://scholarslab.org/events/), designed to connect researchers - at all levels - with expertise, training, and intellectual discourse.  I also manage our [Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/) and serve as the primary point of contact between the Scholars’ Lab and broader library services.

I have a background in English and information science, was the librarian on the Fall 2015 voyage of [Semester at Sea](http://www.semesteratsea.org/), and have an ongoing interest in digital publishing and open scholarly communication.
