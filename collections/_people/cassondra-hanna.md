Cassondra is a rising Sophomore at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee and a 2018 LAMI Scholar. At Fisk, she studies History & Sociology with a minor in African-American Studies. Cassondra’s research interests follow the intersections of race and class, and their roles within the history of the African-American experience and disenfranchisement. This summer, with the Leadership Alliance Mellon Initiative at UVA, Cassondra will be researching the history of two historically black communities and the impact which was had on their development by 20th century Urban Renewal.
