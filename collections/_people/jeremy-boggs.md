As Head of Research & Development, I focus on front-end development, user interface, user experience, and aesthetics for Scholars' Lab projects, as well as leading the Scholars' Lab R&D team. In addition to helping faculty and students on their research projects, I keep office hours and do research and teaching for our [Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/). I'm currently researching methods for doing distant reading of comic books using computer vision.

I've been a practicing digital humanist for a little over a decade now. I have a Master's degree in History, and have taught courses in history, graphic design, new media, and American studies. I'm also an instructor at [HILT](http://www.dhtraining.org/hilt/) and [Accessible Future](http://www.accessiblefuture.org/). I formerly served as the Communication Officer for the [Association for Computers and the Humanities](http://ach.org).

Ari Beth's and Ella's father. Chaotic Good.
