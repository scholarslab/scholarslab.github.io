Amanda's 2015 dissertation ([Dr.AmandaVisconti.com](http://Dr.AmandaVisconti.com)) was the first humanities dissertation to fully acknowledge digital methods (code, design, user testing, blogging, no chapters) as scholarship by treating them *as* the dissertation instead of addenda to traditional written chapters. The focus of their dissertation was creating the participatory digital edition of James Joyce's _Ulysses_ [InfiniteUlysses.com](http://InfiniteUlysses.com), which attracted over 12,000 unique visitors in its first few weeks of open beta and was cited in _The New York Times_ in July 2016.
