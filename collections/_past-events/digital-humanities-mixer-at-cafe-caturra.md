---

Please join the Digital Humanities organizations on Grounds for delicious snacks, drinks, and fascinating conversation at our first DH@UVa Mixer.  This event is free, of course, but we ask that you [register](https://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/DHUVA_Conference_9-16/) so that we can plan accordingly.

When: Thursday, January 26, from 4-6
Where: [Café Caturra](http://cafecaturra.com/) on the University Corner

We hope you'll take this convivial occasion as an opportunity to extend your DH network and learn about others' projects, methods, and resources. This mixer is sponsored by the [Office of the Vice President for Information Technology](https://vpit.virginia.edu/).
