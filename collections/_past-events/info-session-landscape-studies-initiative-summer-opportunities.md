---

Please join us to learn about the [Landscape Studies Initiative](https://culturallandscapes.arch.virginia.edu/uva-landscape-studies-initiative) and its' **summer opportunities for employment - in research, prototyping, and fieldwork - as well as travel**.

The info session will:




  * introduce the Landscape Studies Initiative, the research team, and their 3-year project to develop a digital platform for the teaching of landscape from a transdisciplinary perspective, which emphasizes the entanglements of places, texts, images, and on-going environmental and anthropocene issues.


  * describe the employment opportunities this summer (with potential academic year extension) including roles prototyping archival api apps and 3d-4d media viewers, developing digital fieldwork protocols, and updating the project bibliography.


  * elaborate on the opportunity to join the Initiative's first fieldwork trip, to Germany (Bad Muskau, Dessau, Potsdam, and Berlin) from August 6th-17th, 2018.


  * address application details - for employment and travel.


_Meg Studer, the program manager, will also take questions._

**The initiative welcomes students from any discipline and department with skills in digital visualization, computation as well as research skills in the humanities.**

More about the [Landscape Studies Initiative](https://culturallandscapes.arch.virginia.edu/uva-landscape-studies-initiative):

_Led by Beth Meyer and Michael Lee, in the A-School, the Mellon-funded Landscape Studies Initiative is creating a digital platform for the teaching of landscape studies. The platform will bring together primary sources as well as historic and contemporary field observations so that the history of the designed landscape is understood as a material as well as a cultural practice. During this 3 yr planning project, the Initiative will test our digital platform in several UVA courses taught in the A-School as well as Lisa Goff (American Studies), and then launch an open source digital resource for students and faculty in and beyond UVA._
