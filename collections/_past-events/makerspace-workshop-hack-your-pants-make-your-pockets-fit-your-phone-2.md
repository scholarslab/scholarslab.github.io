title: 'Makerspace Workshop: Hack Your Pants – Make your Pockets Fit your Phone'
---

Are you tired of your phone poking out of your pocket? Did you get a new Phablet and now you have nowhere to stick it? This workshop will show you how to take an old tshirt and make your pockets bigger. No experience necessary, but you will need to bring your pants and an old tshirt. Warning: you will be cutting your pants pockets, and there is a possibility that the pocket will not be to your liking in the end.
