title: 'Workshop: Introduction to Neatline'
---

Join us for a hands-on introduction to Neatline, a set of plugins for Omeka developed by the Scholarsâ€™ Lab. With Neatline, anyone can create beautiful, complex maps and narrative sequences from collections of archives and artifacts, and connect maps and narratives with timelines that are more-than-usually sensitive to ambiguity and nuance. See http://neatline.org/ for more information.

Instructor: Ronda Grizzle
