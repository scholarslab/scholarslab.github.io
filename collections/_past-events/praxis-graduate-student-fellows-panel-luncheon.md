Please join us for an Ivanhoe Roundtable! Our fantastic 2014-15 [Praxis Fellows](http://scholarslab.org/graduate-fellowships/) will describe the collaboratively-built [Ivanhoe game](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/) and what makes it compelling. They will explore issues of multiple audiences and pedagogical possibilities through two example games.Â  Lunch will follow the presentation.
