![Introduction to Photogrammetry 
with PhotoCatch](/assets/post-media/workshops/photo-catch.png)

Come explore photogrammetry and learn about its wide range of 
applications from terrestrial to aerial photogrammetry! We will be using 
PhotoCatch to map 3D models of different objects, and you're 
welcomed to bring some small objects that you would like to be mapped 
and turned into a 3D model. No experience is required! 

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor.
