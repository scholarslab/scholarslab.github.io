with Fusion 360 & SolidWorks ](/assets/post-media/workshops/fusion-logo.png)

Computer-aided design (CAD) is indispensible in the engineering industry, 
and we will explore some of its applications and the process that 
engineers use to transform an idea into reality. We will be using 
Fusion 360 and/or SolidWorks to get acquainted with some common
design tools in CAD. No experience is required! 

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor.
