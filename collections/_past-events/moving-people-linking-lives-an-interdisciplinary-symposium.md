---

_Friday, March 20 events will take place in the Kaleidoscope Room in Newcomb Hall.
Saturday, March 21 events will take place in Alderman 421 except for an evening reception in the Colonnade Club._

Presentations and workshops will open dialogue across different fields, periods, and methods, from textual interpretation to digital research. [Invited participants](http://movingpeoplelinkinglives.org/abstracts/) include specialists on narrative theory and life writing, prosopography or comparative studies of life narratives in groups, and the diverse field of digital humanities or computer-assisted research on cultural materials, from ancient texts to Colonial archives, from printed books to social media.

Organized and hosted by Alison Booth, Jenny Strauss Clay, and Amy Odgen and sponsored by the Page Barbour Committee, the departments of English, French, and Art, the Institute for Humanities and Global Cultures, the Scholarsâ€™ Lab, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, and other entities at UVa, all events are free and open to the public. A full listing of sessions can be found on [the symposium website](http://movingpeoplelinkinglives.org/), and you can follow @livesdh on twitter for updates.
