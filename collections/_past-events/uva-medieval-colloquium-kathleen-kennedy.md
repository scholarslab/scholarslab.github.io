### _Old Media Studies: New Wine in Old Skins_


Eddie Izzard asks us if we have a flag, and generally speaking, medievalists must answer in the negative. In this talk, Kathleen E. Kennedy unfurls the banner of Old Media Studies and argues that the interdisciplinary, transtemporal future of Medieval Studies may lie right under our hands, in the very books which serve as our primary research resources. Come hear about medieval hackers, Anonymous, and the prayerbook owned by one of Skelton's associates and a crony of Henry VIII.

Kathleen Kennedy is an Associate Professor of English at Penn State-Brandywine. She specializes in medieval and Early Modern English literature and history, and teaches courses on topics ranging from composition to Shakespeare, comic books to western civilization.Â  This event is co-sponsored by U.Va.'s Medieval Colloquium and the Scholars' Lab.
