Join the Scholars’ Lab and Meghan Ferriter from the National Digital Initiatives division at the Library of Congress to explore LC Labs ([http://labs.loc.gov/](http://labs.loc.gov/)). This new space is designed to empower exploration and discovery in the digital collections of the Library of Congress. In this workshop, you’ll tour labs.loc.gov and the Library of Congress’ crowdsourcing pilot [Beyond Words;](http://beyondwords.labs.loc.gov/#/) then you’ll dig into the crowdsourced & public domain data generated by a generous public. **Please bring your own device to explore labs.loc.gov and Beyond Words.**

**Meghan Ferriter** is Senior Innovation Specialist with the National Digital Initiatives division in the National and International Outreach directorate at the Library of Congress.

The Library of Congress launched [http://labs.loc.gov/](http://labs.loc.gov/) to provide a space for open experimentation with Library digital collections. There, they want to highlight the visualizations, research, and innovation that machine-readable collections and data make possible and to help others explore what's possible.
