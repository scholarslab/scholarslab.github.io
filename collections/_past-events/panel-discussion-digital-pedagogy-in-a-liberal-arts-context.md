For the last few years, UVA graduate students have had the opportunity to visit Washington and Lee University to facilitate workshops and give lectures on digital humanities topics. On Wednesday, October 26th W&L Faculty and UVA graduate students will speak about the collaboration, discussing lessons learned from digital humanities in a liberal arts context and possibilities for future collaborations. The panel of speakers will discuss a range of topics broached in these classroom visits, including collaborative digital annotation, introductory project management for digital work, and humanities software development for non-programmers. Throughout, the presenters will focus on the professional, pedagogical, and personal opportunities that can be gained by graduate students gaining experience teaching in a liberal arts environment. We will have ample time for conversation, as we hope the event will seed future collaborations among researchers at both institutions.
