#### **Please join us for two days of conversation and insights with the digital humanities community at UVa.**


On October 14 and 15**,** the DH community at UVa will come together for a multiplicity of conversations about what innovative digital work is happening here now. As our community of practice grows and evolves, we are taking a moment to reflect and exchange ideas about what can happen in the future. Join us for lighting talks, roundtables, and ongoing public dialogue. Invited speakers include Lauren Klein, Tanya Clement, and Chris Johanson.
