Computer-aided design (CAD) is indispensible in the engineering industry, and we'll explore some of its applications and the process that engineers use to transform an idea into reality. We will be using SolidWorks to get acquainted with some common design tools in CAD. No experience is required!


Bring a Windows laptop with SolidWorks installed (Download a free license for Windows, virginia.service-now.com/its?id=software_gateway&sys_id=82089b97dbfcab00cebc550a489619b5). Download the free trial from https://www.solidworks.com/product/solidworks-3d-cad and install, then use the license from UVA.

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor. See here for TinkerTank open hours: <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours</a>
