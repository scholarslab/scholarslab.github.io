Based loosely on the life of Margaret Clap, and the myth of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus — SideSaddle* is an [ open-source text ](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) published by [SpringGun Press](http://springgunpress.com), [released online](http://oddbooksapp.com/book/ridingsidesaddle) by [OddBird](http://oddbird.net/), and adapted to the stage by [Buntport Theater](http://buntport.com/archive/archive.htm) and [Teacup Gorilla](http://teacupgorilla.com).
