We are now accepting applications for the 2018-2019 DH Fellows Cohort. Please visit [https://tinyurl.com/SLabDHFellows2018-2019](https://tinyurl.com/SLabDHFellows2018-2019) for complete information.

Applications are due **Wednesday, November 1st, 2017.**

The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development.

Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.

Supported by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund, and a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
