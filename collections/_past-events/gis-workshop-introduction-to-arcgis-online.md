With ArcGIS Online, you can use and create maps and scenes, access ready-to-use maps, layers and analytics, publish data as web layers, collaborate and share, access maps from any device, make maps with your Microsoft Excel data, customize the ArcGIS Online website, and view status reports. You can also use ArcGIS Online as a platform to build custom location-based apps.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Thursdays from 3PM to 4PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholarsâ€™ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
