**#TranscribeBond**

Join us in the Scholar's Lab for this all-day event transcribing a varied sample of the papers and speeches of Julian Bond, in an effort to produce a digital edition of his work. Refreshments will be provided!

The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library and the Scholars' Lab are collaborating with the Carter G. Woodson Institute of African-American and African Studies in a crowd-sourced project to make the papers of Civil Rights legend and UVA professor Julian Bond available online.

This two-day event begins on Tuesday, August 14 at 4:00 PM, at the Woodson Institute in 110 Minor Hall, where the scope and goals of the edition will be announced, with a reception to follow at 5:30 PM.

Those who would like to attend the reception and/or participate in the transcription process can RSVP **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q1qh4hHCJdbcseU5RUC7cZ6vKWG3O3fWCkWT0wRDRps/edit)**.

Those wishing to participate, but unable to join in person, can still contribute remotely by accessing the **[project workspace](http://fromthepage.com/centerfordigitalediting/the-papers-of-julian-bond)** on FromThePage when it goes live in August and engaging with the hashtag #TranscribeBond.
