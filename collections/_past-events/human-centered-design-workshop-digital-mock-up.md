This workshop series is for everyone who wants to "create something that is useful and will make people happy.” You will develop your own small project over four weeks, culminating in a prototype that makes you proud.  The sessions will build on each other, and you can count on a few out-of-class hours of work per week, but we promise to have a lot of fun!

**In session 3, you will learn how to create a more concrete prototype of your idea (using PowerPoint or Impress) and continue to refine your design.**
