title: 'GIS Workshop: Points on Your Map – Street Addresses and More Spatial Things'
---

Do you have a list of street addresses crying out to be mapped?  Have a list of zip codes or census tracts you wish to associate with other data?  We’ll start with addresses and other things spatial and end with points on a map, ready for visualization and analysis.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.  No registration, just show up!

For the full schedule of the [Fall 2018 UVa Library GIS Workshop Series](http://scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/fall-2018-uva-library-gis-workshop-series/), see [here](http://scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/fall-2018-uva-library-gis-workshop-series/).
