THIS WORKSHOP IS CANCELED TODAY DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS.

Do you think 3D modeling has to be expensive and time-consuming? Are you curious about 3D printing but unsure where to start?

This workshop will introduce participants to the exciting world of desktop fabrication. We'll provide a brief overview of current trends and tools for 3D modeling and printing. We'll also go over the basics of model creation with photogrammetry, and discuss how 3D printing works, including a live demonstration with one of our Makerbots. While not necessary, participants can bring a camera (cell phone cameras welcome!) and a laptop to get better acquainted with the software we'll introduce.

If you can't make this session but would like to learn more about 3D printing, please visit our the student consultants in our [Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/) or email [scholarslab@virginia.edu](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) to set up an individual appointment.
