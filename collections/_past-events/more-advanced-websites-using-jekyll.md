Take your website building to the next level. This workshop requires some experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript. We will be using Jekyll to build a static website, with the benefit of Jekyll's templates, tags, and other features. Bring your own laptop or we can provide one. We'll work through a project together to learn the skills that you can apply later on your own.
