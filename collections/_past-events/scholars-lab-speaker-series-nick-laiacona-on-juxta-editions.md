**_Using Juxta Editions to Create Digital Scholarly Editions_**

[Juxta Editions](http://virginia.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3ac105f4d87dddbd34542ab41&id=e89765a555&e=044d81c254) is a professional editing suite for the creation of digital scholarly editions. Scholarly editors, historians, archivists, and academic librarians are routinely using the Internet to share primary source material with one another and the public. However, the set of technologies required to deliver a state-of-the-art scholarly edition remains difficult to master. Using Juxta, you can transcribe, annotate, collate, and publish to the Internet a work or collection of related writings. The session includes a demonstration of Juxta Editions.
