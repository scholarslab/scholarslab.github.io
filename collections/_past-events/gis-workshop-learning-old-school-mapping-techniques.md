How did folks make maps before GPS and satellite imagery?  In this workshop we’ll focus on plane table mapping.  Using just a flat surface, a sheet of paper, a straight edge, and a pencil we’ll learn techniques to create accurate maps for large geographic areas.   With plane table mapping, if you can see it, you can map it.  This technique can be particularly helpful to researchers such a biologists working in small areas under heavy tree canopy where GPS fails.

All sessions are one hour and assume attendees have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials with expert assistance. All sessions will be taught in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free to attend and are open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
