Project Description:




The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort has moved the material history of UVA out of Special Collections and onto Grounds. Using a mobile Artifical Reality application, UVA Reveal explores otherwise hidden stories, histories, and questions surrounding objects and areas at UVA. In doing so, UVA Reveal prompts users to re-examine their everyday spaces and critically reflect on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university.
