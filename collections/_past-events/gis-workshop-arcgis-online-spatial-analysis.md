ArcGIS Online now has spatial analysis tools that can be easier to use than similar desktop GIS tools.  Come learn how to use the simple yet powerful analysis tools available through ArcGIS Online.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be held on **Tuesdays from 10AM to 11AM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.  No registration, just show up!
