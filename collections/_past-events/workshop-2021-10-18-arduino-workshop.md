Come learn about the Arduino micro-controller for fun or profit. No experience needed. This workshop will go through the very basics of electricity, how to setup the Arduino, and building a first circuit; an LED nightlight. 

This is a live, in-person workshop. 

No prior experience required, and all equipment is provided.

If you want your own, Arduino kits can be purchased from Amazon or many other sources: https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Project-Tutorial-Controller-Projects/dp/B01D8KOZF4

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor.
