title: 'GIS Workshop: Making Your First Map'
---

Getting started with new software can be intimidating. This workshop introduces the skills you need to work with spatial goodness. Along the way you’ll get a taste of Earth’s most popular geographic software and a gentle introduction to map making. You’ll leave with your own cartographic masterpiece and tips for learning more in your pursuit of mappiness at UVa.

All sessions are one hour and assume attendees have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials with expert assistance. All sessions will be taught in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free to attend and are open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
