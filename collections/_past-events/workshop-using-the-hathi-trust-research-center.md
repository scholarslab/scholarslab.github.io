title: 'DH Workshop: Introduction to the Hathi Trust Research Center'
---

Progressively greater access to digitized books and documents is creating opportunities for researchers to ask new data-driven questions about literary and linguistic change, history, and cultural trends. HathiTrust is a consortium of research libraries, and its digital library currently contains over 15 million items. The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) seeks to make this very large collection accessible for non-consumptive research via algorithmic text analysis. This hands-on session will introduce attendees to the HTRC’s tools and services, including how to execute algorithms against user-created sub-collections of text, how to use the HathiTrust+Bookworm tool for lexical trend discovery, and how to perform text analysis using HTRC-developed infrastructure and datasets."

The workshop, co-sponsored by the UVA Library's departments of Arts & Humanities Research, Research Data Services, and the Scholars' Lab, is open to faculty, students and staff.  Lunch will be provided.  Please join us!
