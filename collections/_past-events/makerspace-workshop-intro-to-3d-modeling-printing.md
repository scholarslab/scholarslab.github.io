title: 'Makerspace Workshop: Intro to 3D Modeling & Printing'
---

Do you think 3D modeling has to be expensive and time-consuming? Are you curious about 3D printing but unsure where to start?

This workshop will introduce participants to the exciting world of desktop fabrication. We'll provide a brief overview of current trends and tools for 3D modeling and printing. We?ll also go over the basics of model creation with photogrammetry, and discuss how 3D printing works, including a live demonstration with our Makerbot Replicator 2. While not necessary, participants can bring a camera (cell phone cameras welcome!) and a laptop to get better acquainted with the software we'll introduce.
