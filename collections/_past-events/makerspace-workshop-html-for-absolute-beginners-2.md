Wondering how web sites work? Wanting to get started creating web content of your own, but have no idea how to do that? This is the class for you. We'll cover everything from how URLs work to basic HTML coding skills to basic netiquette. This workshop is intended for absolute beginners with no knowledge of HTML.

Our sessions assume attendees have no previous experience, and will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials with expert assistance. All sessions will be taught in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholarsâ€™ Lab) and are free to attend and are open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
