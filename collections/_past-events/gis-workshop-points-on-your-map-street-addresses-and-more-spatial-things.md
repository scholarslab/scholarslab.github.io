title: 'GIS Workshop: Points on Your Map—Street Addresses and More Spatial Things'
---

Do you have a list of street addresses crying out to be mapped? Have a list of zip codes or census tracts you wish to associate with other data? We’ll start with addresses and other things spatial and end with points on a map, ready for visualization and analysis.

All sessions are one hour and assume attendees have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials with expert assistance. All sessions will be taught in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free to attend and are open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
