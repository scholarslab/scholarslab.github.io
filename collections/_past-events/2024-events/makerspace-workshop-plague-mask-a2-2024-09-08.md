(This is Part 2 of a Workshop Series. Please do not sign up if you have not came to Part I or contacted the Cosplay Cosuming & Crafts Club beforehand)

Bring your WIP project from the previous workshop to attend this program.

Come make your own plague doctor mask prop with the Cosplay Costuming & Crafts Club! All supplies and materials will be supplied. The workshop lasts 3 hours and you are encouraged to arrive on time. You may stay the full time or leave early if you finish before the event ends. In WorkShop Part 1, you will (hopefully) finish the base construction of the mask and prime it for painting. In Workshop Part 2 you will learn techiniques such as dry brushing and weathering to paint your mask. This RSVP only signs you up for Part 2 of the Workshop Series, please only RSVP if you have already signed up/completed Part 1

Due to a waitlist, if you have to cancel your RSVP, please do so at least 24 hours in advance to the time the event occurs. For inquiries, contact virginiacostuming@gmail.com
