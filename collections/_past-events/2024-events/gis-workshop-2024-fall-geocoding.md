Do you have a list of street addresses crying out to be mapped?  Have a list of zip codes or census tracts you wish to associate with other data?  Weâ€™ll start with addresses and other things spatial and end with points on a map, ready for visualization and analysis.  

Registration is required. All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. They will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM** in Shannon 317 and virtually, and are free and open to the UVA and larger Charlottesville community. Check out the registration page for more info.
