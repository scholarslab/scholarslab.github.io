slug: makerspace-workshop-plague-mask-a1-2024-09-06

Come make your own plague doctor mask prop with the Cosplay Costuming & Crafts Club! All supplies and materials will be supplied. The workshop lasts 3 hours and you WILL need the full time to finish the first half of the project. In WorkShop Part 1, you will (hopefully) finish the base construction of the mask and prime it for painting. In Workshop Part 2 you will learn techiniques such as dry brushing and weathering to paint your mask. This RSVP only signs you up for Part 1 of the Workshop Series, please reserve Part II if you would like to come back for painting.

Due to a waitlist, if you have to cancel your RSVP, please do so at least 24 hours in advance to the time the event occurs. For inquiries, contact virginiacostuming@gmail.com
