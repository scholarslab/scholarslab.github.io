A Special Collections exhibit on Harlem Renaissance poet and activist Anne Spencer, curated by Faculty Director Alison Booth, will open to the public starting 10/22/2024, with an opening celebration 5:30pm-7pm in Harrison-Small Library. 3D scanning and VR exhibit work, including the capture and creation of a VR exhibit of Spencer's writing cottage Edankraal, was contributed by Scholars' Lab's [Will Rourk](/people/will-rourk) and [Arin Bennett](/people/arin-bennett).

Come hear brief talks by Camille Dungy, Shaun Spencer-Hester (Director of the Spencer House and Garden Museum), and Alison Booth. Holly Robertson, Krystal Appiah, Jacquelyn Kim, and English major Tessa Berman, as well as Shaun and Alison collaborated on this exhibit about Lynchburg poet and saloni√®re, librarian, activist, gardener Anne Spencer (1882-1975) who is widely anthologized in the Harlem Renaissance journals and anthologies. In March (TBD), we plan a further symposium on Black women poets moderated by Lauren Alleyne, Director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center at JMU.

The exhibit will remain through spring semester.
