Would you like to see historical maps overlaid on modern aerial photography?  Do you need to extract features from a map for use in GIS?  Georeferencing is the first step.  We will show you how to take a scan of a paper map and align in it in ArcGIS.

Registration is required. All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. They will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM** in Shannon 317 and virtually, and are free and open to the UVA and larger Charlottesville community. Check out the registration page for more info.
