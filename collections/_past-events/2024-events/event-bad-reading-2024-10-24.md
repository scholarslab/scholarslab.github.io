â€œDigital/Analog Reading: A Symposium" is an event of the IHGC's Reading Lab working group. The symposium is convened by Jack Chen (East Asian Languages), Rennie Mapp (Digital Humanities Initiative), and Alison Booth (Library DH Center/English). 

Participants will include: Anatoly Detwyler (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Nicholas Frankel (VCU), Christina Lupton (University of Copenhagen), Bonnie Mak (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign); Allen Riddell (Indiana University Bloomington), and Inge van den Ven (Tilburg University).

The format will be the same as past IHGC reading symposia: short papers and plenty of time for conversation. Main location is IHGC (ground floor of Wilson Hall), with some events possibly in the Scholars' lab and other locations (details to come).
