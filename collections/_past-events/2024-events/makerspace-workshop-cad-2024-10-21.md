Computer-aided design (CAD) is indispensible in the engineering industry, and we'll explore some of its applications and the process that engineers use to transform an idea into reality. We will be using SolidWorks to get acquainted with some common design tools in CAD. No experience is required!

If you have a Windows laptop, feel free to bring it with SolidWorks installed (Download a free license for Windows, virginia.service-now.com/its?id=software_gateway&sys_id=82089b97dbfcab00cebc550a489619b5). Download the free trial from https://www.solidworks.com/product/solidworks-3d-cad and install, then use the license from UVA.
