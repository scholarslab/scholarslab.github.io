Are you applying to jobs or internships and need a second eye on your application? Join us for an in-person resume review, where you'll get feedback from the Critical Making Fellow, Holly Zhou, who worked for several years as a senior software engineer at Google. Holly also has engineering experience at Amazon and in various biotech startups. Prior to software engineering, they worked as a research scientist, working across genomics, finite element modeling, and ecology. 

During the workshop, you'll receive 1:1 feedback on how to word and sequence your resume and insights into what recruiters might be looking for. This event is open to all students looking for a role within the engineering space.
