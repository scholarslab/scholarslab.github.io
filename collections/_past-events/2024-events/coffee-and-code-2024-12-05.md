title: 'Coffee + Code Weekly Meetup: Demo of Edition Crafter'
---

The December 5 session will host a demonsration of [Edition
Crafter](https://editioncrafter.org/) developed by Performant Software. EditionCrafter is an open source tool for publishing digital editions encoded in TEI XML. It is based on code from the digital critical edition ["Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France"](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) published by the Making and Knowing Project at the Center for Science and Society at Columbia University. EditionCrafter can generate sophisticated diplomatic renderings of text side-by-side with a deep zoom window of the original folios. There are also built-in functions for variorums, editorial notes, and glossaries. In this presentation, we will talk about how we created EditionCrafter and demonstrate how to incorporate it into your website.

September 19-December 5, join the [Research and Development](/code-design/) team for delicious coffee and discussion of interesting digital humanities code work. Zero experience required; these are non-sequential, so come for any or all.
