Do you have a list of Lat/Lon coordinates you would like to see on a map? We will show you how to do that, and more. ArcGIS Pro makes it easy to take your tabular data and generate stylized points on a map.

Registration is required. All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. They will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM** in Shannon 317 and virtually, and are free and open to the UVA and larger Charlottesville community. Check out the registration page for more info.
