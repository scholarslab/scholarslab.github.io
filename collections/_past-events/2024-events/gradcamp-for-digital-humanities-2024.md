Are you a graduate student who's headlong into your Digital Humanities
certificate? Are you interested in digital methods and approaches for you own
work but not sure how or where to start? Join us in the Scholars' Lab on August
26 for our first GradCamp for Digital Humanities. This free, low-pressure, and welcoming get-together looks
to provide graduate students with introductions to Digital Humanities as a
community of practice and a field of research. In the morning (9-12), we'll share a
modest introduction to DH, provide guidance on project management best
practices, and discuss approaches to publishing your own personal site. In the
afternoon (1-3pm), we'll break out into interest groups covering geospatial technology,
text analysis, and programming + data management. The ultimate goal for the day
is to help you develop a better sense of the areas and methods in digital
humanities you can explore in further depth with Scholars' Lab staff throughout the
academic year.

Lunch will be provided! Please register for the event and share any dietary
restrictions/preferences and other accommodations you need. The only thing you
absolutely need to bring is your interest and attention, but a laptop would be
handy.
