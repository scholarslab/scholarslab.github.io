Channel your inner hatred towards textbooks, fight back against this world of strife. Come to the Makerspace and make your own book safe (by tearing textbooks apart) and hide your stuff. Recommended for beginners and engineering students! All materials (including books) are provided. Consider bringing your own book if you want a specific external appearance.
