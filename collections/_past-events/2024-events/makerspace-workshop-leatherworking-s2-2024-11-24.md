Join us at the Makerspace with the CCC Club to learn the basics of leatherworking! Get acquainted with the tools typically used and hone your carving skills. This is a cost-free workshop (all materials will be provided) and is beginner-friendly! From simple keychains to wallets to something more complex — whatever you can imagine, try your hand at crafting it!

Participants are encouraged to arrive on time to get the most out of the workshop, but feel free to leave if you finish working on your project before the end of the event!

There are three sessions — you only need to register for and attend one of these sessions. Due to a waitlist, please cancel your RSVP 24 hours in advance if you can no longer attend.

For inquiries, please email virginiacostuming@gmail.com.

This workshop is sponsored by the UVA Parents Program.
