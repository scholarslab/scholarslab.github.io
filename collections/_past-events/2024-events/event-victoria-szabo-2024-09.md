Please join us in welcoming Victoria Szabo to the Scholars' Lab and the DH Center for her talk, "Critical Approaches to Visualizing Cities: Representing the Past and Cultural Memory".

For the last 15+ years the Digital Art History & Visual Culture Research Lab (formerly Wired!) at Duke University has sponsored Visualizing Cities courses and projects, often in collaboration with colleagues in Italy, and with local community partners.  Such projects surface critical questions around representing the urban past and engaging with cultural memory.  This talk will introduce the “Virtual Black Charlotte” project as well as share findings from our recent Getty Foundation-sponsored Summer Institute in Venice, “Exhibiting Hidden Histories: Bringing Art History Projects to Publics through Digital Exhibitions and XR.”

No RSVP is required, but you can add the event to your calendar via the link at [the LibCal page](https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/calendar/events/VictoriaSzabo). This Scholars' Lab event is co-sponsored by the Karsh Institute of Democracy, the Institute for Humanities and Global Cultures, as well as the Digital Humanities Center, UVA Library.

_Victoria Szabo is Research Professor of Visual and Media Studies in the Department of Art, Art History & Visual Studies, Graduate Faculty in Computational Media Arts & Cultures at Duke University.
