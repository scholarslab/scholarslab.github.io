3D visualization technologies are engaged across the digital humanities to document, imagine, and interpret historic sites, past events, cultural heritage objects, fictional spaces and narratives, and more. How can it be used to engage students' learning? Where do we begin when teaching humanities with 3D technologies? This workshop will address these questions drawing on not only participants' experiences but also a decade of pedagogical practice in Duke University's Digital Art History & Visual Culture Research Lab. We'll discuss how pedagogy and ethics can inform our approach to 3D platforms and methods in the classroom, and we'll get hands-on experience with assignment design through an introductory 3D modeling tutorial using [SketchUp for Web](https://virginia.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3ac105f4d87dddbd34542ab41&id=d03b2073c8&e=044d81c254) (free with account).
