Join us for a hands-on workshop where you’ll learn to design and sew your own unique tote bag. Whether you need it for record shopping, farmers market walking, or any other super awesome outing, this workshop will help you bring your tote bag ideas to life

No experience is needed! We’ll provide all materials and guidance. Plus, you’ll leave with a custom-made tote and a new skill set to keep sewing.

Feel free to bring any unique adornments to add a personal touch to your creation!
