**_Apple's iOS App Ecology: An Introduction (for People Who Code or Want to Hire a Developer)_**

**Ross Harding** will demonstrate the iOS development process he used to build PocketHinman, a bibliographical research tool developed (along with collaborator **James Ascher**) as part of the IHGC Public Humanities Lab. This workshop and discussion should be useful if you already know how to code in Swift, think you could learn, but want a quick introduction to developing apps for iOS; or are interested in hiring a developer to help make an app and need to know how to set reasonable milestones for their work.

Refreshments will be provided.
