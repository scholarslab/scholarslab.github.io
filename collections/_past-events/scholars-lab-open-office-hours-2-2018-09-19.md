**Wednesdays throughout the Fall Semester**

Just drop in – no appointment needed! Come with your curiosity, your ideas for projects, your technical, design, and project scoping questions, or just the desire to meet others engaged in digital work.  If you can’t make our Wednesday hours, you are always welcome to come by our office in Alderman 415 or schedule an appointment at [scholarslab@virginia.edu](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=scholarslab@virginia.edu).
