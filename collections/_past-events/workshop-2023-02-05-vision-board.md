![Vision Board Your Year!](/assets/post-media/workshops/vision-board.png)

Take some time to practice mindfulness and goal-setting by making a vision board for 2023. Plan out your year, relax from class stress, and create a beautiful vision board to remind you of your goals throughout the year. Materials will be provided, but if you have images, stickers, or pieces of magazine or newspaper that you want to put on your board, feel free to bring them along!

Drop in anytime between 3:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. to make your vision board. 

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor. See here for TinkerTank open hours: <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours</a>
