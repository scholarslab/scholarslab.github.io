Do you have file names like: Paper.doc, Paper-revision1.doc, Paper-v2.doc, Paper-Final.doc, Paper-Final2.doc? Have you heard of version control, but not sure how to get it working for you? This workshop will give you an overview of how to use Git and GitHub to version your documents (word processing, coding document, or any type of files). This is a workshop for absolute beginners, so no experience is required. We will mostly be talking about version control from a theoretical standpoint, and won’t be installing or using git on your own computers.
