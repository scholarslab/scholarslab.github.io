title: 'GIS Workshop: Introduction to ArcGIS Pro'
---

The handwriting is on the wall.  ArcGIS Pro will be replacing ArcMap as the desktop GIS in the near future.  Come learn what’s the same and what’s new, and how this powerful new tool incorporates seamlessly with ArcGIS Online and ESRI’s cloud-based mapping tools.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.  No registration, just show up!

For the full schedule of the [Fall 2018 UVa Library GIS Workshop Series](http://scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/fall-2018-uva-library-gis-workshop-series/), see [here](http://scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/fall-2018-uva-library-gis-workshop-series/).
