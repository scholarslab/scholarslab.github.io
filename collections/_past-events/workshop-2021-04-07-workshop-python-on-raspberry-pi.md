Step into the world of coding and computer programming using the smallest computer and easiest programming language. In this workshop you will learn how to set up your Raspberry Pi and begin coding with the Python language. This is a basic programming class with no prior experience necessary. You will learn about the Python language, and how to write a program that asks for a users' age and returns the year they were born and the most popular song that year.

This is a live, virtual workshop. After registration, you will receive a link for participation.

Requirements: Raspberry Pi, HDMI monitor, HDMI cable, USB keyboard, USB mouse OR any computer with Python pre-installed.

Raspberry Pis can be purchased from Amazon or many other sources: [https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
