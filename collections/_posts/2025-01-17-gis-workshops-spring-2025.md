Or is it Happily ever Mapter? Definitely not Mappily Ever Mapter though, that would be silly. Anyway, if your goal is to learn GIS, this workshop series may have the fairytale ending you're hoping for. If nothing else, you'll leave these sessions feeling spatial. 

Spring will allegedy be springing - depending on when you're reading this, you may have missed or forgotten the mini ice age we are currently experiencing. Regardless, it's a new year and it's a good enough time for us to shift gears and turn our workshop focus to ArcGIS Online (AGOL), Esri's GIS solution for the cloud. AGOL is browser-based, eliminating any Windows vs. Mac shenanigans, and allowing us to provide temporary access to members of the community that don't have UVA credentials. 

- **Registration is required**, please use the links below or check out our [Events page](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/events/) to sign up. 
- All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. They will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials. 
- Sessions will be taught on **Tuesdays from 1PM to 2PM** in Shannon Library 308 and virtually and are free and open to the UVA and larger Charlottesville community. 
- Please bring your laptop. If you don't have a laptop, we're able to provide one.  

**January 28th - Introduction to ArcGIS Online**

ArcGIS Online is the cloud-based younger sibling of ArcGIS Pro. It can't do some of the less flashy, GISy kind of things, but it's in the cloud, it's connected, which adds all the hip functionality we've come to expect. With ArcGIS Online, you can find and create spatial data, maps, and applications. Access a limited but powerful set of analysis tools that take advantage of cloud computing and pre-configured data and resources. Share and collaborate with small groups or with the world. It's an easy-to-use entry into the world of GIS, all from the comfort of your browser.

**February 25th - Spatial Analysis with ArcGIS Online**

Perform basic analysis with tools like Buffer and Spatial Join. Or, enhance your data, taking advantage of the always up-to-date elevation, streets, and demographics data available in ArcGIS Online with tools like Create Viewshed, Find Nearest, and Enrich. Come for the learning and stay for stories about the old days when we had to create all that data ourselves. Uphill. Both ways!!

**March 18th - App Your Map with Experience Builder**

Continuing with the app theme, we'll go beyond templates into custom application creation. Would you like to make a custom online mapping application without having to code? We would, and do. ArcGIS Experience Builder allows users of all levels to drag and drop tools to create responsive mapping applications, from simple to expansive.
