I'm interested in queer (and particularly trans) history and technologies. This overlaps with my book history research and book arts practice not just in the research papers, zines, and prints I create, but in the accessibility and representation of the printing materials I find or make, and the events and spaces I'm involved in as well.

I'm working to slowly collect historical LGBTQIA+ letterpress cuts (graphic printing blocks with illustrations and sometimes text)—and since these are scarce (for reasons of safety, permanence, and intended audience), trying to think about what cuts work as part of a queer letterpress collection today—what cuts *I* can queer.

I'm also designing and lasercutting my own new queer catchwords and cuts. And I hope to eventually combine these to scan some historical cuts, alter them in queer ways :D, and lasercut new queerer blocks.

Here's a quick view of some of my historical & DIY collection ([easier viewing as a full webpage here](https://airtable.com/appGBrJR67bFnLJqv/shrZSmqiA0oRoHRzR)):
