### Idiosyncrasy at Scale: Data Curation in the Humanities


On March 25th, [John Unsworth](http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/), Dean of the [Graduate School of Library and Information Science](http://www.lis.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign spoke as part of the UVa Digital Humanities Speaker Series.  This is a speaker series jointly sponsored by SHANTI, IATH, and the Scholars' Lab at UVa Library.

In this talk, Unsworth announced that Indiana University and the University of Illinois were soon to launch the [HathiTrust](http://www.hathitrust.org/about) Research Center -- which will develop "cutting-edge software tools and cyberinfrastructure to enable advanced computational access to the growing digital record of human knowledge." A [formal press release](http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/18245.html) for the project has since appeared.

As usual, you can listen to (or [subscribe to](http://www.scholarslab.org/category/podcasts/)) our podcasts on the Scholars' Lab blog, or [on iTunesU](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fitunes-u%2Fscholars-lab-speaker-series%2Fid401906619&rct=j&q=scholars%27%20lab%20itunes&ei=FI61TdiZNo-Dtge0g_3pDg&usg=AFQjCNGGTBvTY5QpL9aRCKh7rjEOtlLAUQ&sig2=KBrhIc1DK814RPqoAB85Tg&cad=rja).
