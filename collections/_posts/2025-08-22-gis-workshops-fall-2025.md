 Jet on in to our Fall GIS Workshop Series. In between arguments among Chris and I about which one of us is Maverick and which one is Goose, we'll be covering basic GIS operations. I know Goose is from the first movie, but I can't remember any other characters from the sequel. I think [Jon Hamm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiLJsOsRKUI) is in it?  

 This semester we'll primarily be GISing with the desktop GIS software ArcGIS Pro, covering basic use and techniques that will get you comfortable and exploring on your own. If you're interested in ArcGIS Online, we'll briefly cover that in the last couple of sessions, and will do a [deeper dive in the Spring](https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/gis/teaching_resources#s-lib-ctab-22148924-4). Not sure what the difference is? ArcGIS Pro is a Windows-only desktop program that you install on your (Windows) computer. ArcGIS Online is a web-based GIS platform that you access through a web browser on nearly any device. Mark Patterson sums it up  well [here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/bf37fb8c97ca405c8876553101933f4e). Still not sure? As always, feel free to [ping us](mailto:uvagis@virginia.edu) with any questions. 

- Sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. These will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials.
- We will meet **in-person** in the Scholars’ Lab (Shannon Library 308) on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM**, and openly welcome the UVA and larger Charlottesville community. 
- We will provide laptops for easy access to ArcGIS Pro. 
- Walk-ins are welcome, but due to a limited number of laptops, **we strongly encourage registering** using the links below or at our [Events page](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/events/). If you're waitlisted, please contact us at [uvagis@virginia.edu](mailto:uvagis@virginia.edu).
- We **will not be offering a virtual option** this semester. We apologize for any inconvenience. 

**September 10th - Making Your First Map with ArcGIS Pro**

Here’s your chance to get started with geographic information systems software in a friendly, jargon-free environment. This workshop introduces the skills you need to make your own maps. Along the way you’ll get familiar with the desktop GIS application ArcGIS Pro, and a gentle introduction to cartography. You’ll leave with your own cartographic masterpieces and tips for learning more in your pursuit of mappiness at UVA.

**September 17th - Putting Old Maps and Aerial Photos on Your Map: Georeferencing in ArcGIS Pro**

Would you like to see historical maps overlaid on modern aerial photography?  Do you need to extract features of a map for use in GIS?  Georeferencing is the first step.  We will show you how to take a scan of a paper map and align in it in ArcGIS.

**September 24th - Getting Your Data on a Map, Plotting Lat/Lon Coordinates**

Do you have a spreadsheet of Lat/Lon coordinates you would like to see on a map? We will show you how to do that and more. ArcGIS Pro makes it easy to take your tabular data and generate stylized points on a map.

**October 1st - Mapping Street Addresses (Geocoding), and More Spatial Things**

Do you have a list of street addresses crying out to be mapped?  Have a list of zip codes or census tracts you wish to associate with other data?  We’ll start with addresses and other things spatial and end with points on a map, ready for visualization and analysis.

**October 8th - Taking Control of Your Spatial Data: Editing in ArcGIS Pro**

Until we perfect that magic “extract all those lines from this paper map” button we’re stuck using editing tools to get that job done.  If you’re lucky, someone else has done the work to create your points, lines, and polygons but maybe they need your magic touch to make them better.  This session shows you how to create and modify vector features in ArcGIS Pro.  We’ll explore tools to create new points, lines, and polygons and to edit existing datasets.

**October 15th - Easy Demographics**

Need to make a quick demographic map?  This workshop will show you how easily navigate Social Explorer.  This powerful online application makes it easy to create maps with contemporary and historic census data and religious information.

**October 22nd - Introduction to ArcGIS Online**

With ArcGIS Online, you can use and create maps and scenes, access ready-to-use maps, layers and analytics, publish data as web layers, collaborate and share, access maps from any device, make maps with your spreadsheet data, customize the ArcGIS Online website, and view status reports.

**October 29th - ArcGIS Story Maps**

ArcGIS StoryMaps is a spatially enabled website/application builder that allows you to add narrative and multimedia context to your ArcGIS Online maps (or locational context to your narrative and multimedia content, depending on how your brain works). Whether telling a story, giving a tour or comparing historical maps, ArcGIS StoryMaps is an easy-to-use builder that creates polished presentations.
