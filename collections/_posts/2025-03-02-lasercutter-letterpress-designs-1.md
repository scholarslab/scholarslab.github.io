I've been experimenting with lasercutting type-high wood to make letterpress blocks for letterpress printing ([read more & pretty pictures here](https://literaturegeek.com/2025-03-01-lasercutter-letterpress)). Since someone [asked on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3li5kdaatkk2k), I'm now sharing some of the recent files I've lasercut, which are free to use with a CC-BY-NC license, which means you need to credit me when sharing them (Amanda Wyatt Visconti / [AmandaVisconti.com](https://AmandaVisconti.com)) and cannot sell them nor include them in a sold thing. 

You can use these for stickers or other purposes; to lasercut them for printing on wood, lino, or other materials, reflect (flip) the images horizontally before carving, so they read correctly when pressed against paper with ink. Here's an example of one of the images I flipped and lasercut into wood for letterpress printing use:

![Adobe Illustrator design intended for creating letterpress printing blocks by cutting via lasercutter onto wood, to use to print the image to paper with ink; to achieve this, the black & white colors are inverted. The image will also need to be horizontally flipped, so that when the block is pressed to paper the inked image is legible; but for social media viewing I have left it unflipped.

## "made by a trans printer!" on manicule with Erin Moore's Vision font on "trans"

## "we are older than your laws and we will outlive them"
The text in this design quotes the text from [CoyoteSnout's](https://etsy.com/shop/Coyotesnout) art, which quotes an old Yiddish lyric with a 20th-century history of resistance/defiance to Jewish persecution and murder ("we will outlive them") put into the context of trans rights (there have always been trans people).

The design is “CoyoteSnout’s text “we are older than your laws & we will survive them” in an antique broadside-style typeface, all over a flag-shaped rectangle divided by by bars into 5 equal sections so it can be later colored in with trans or other pride flag color schemes](https://literaturegeek.com/assets/post-media/2025-03-03-lasercutter-letterpress-designs-1/older-than-their-laws_CCBYNC-AmandaWyattVisconti-1.svg)

## "Critical tech! No 'innovation' serving profits over people" + Luddite
This uses a personally digitally edited version of a public domain image from a historical illustration of a Luddite.
