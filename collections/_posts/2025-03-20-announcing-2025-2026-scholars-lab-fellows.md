We are thrilled to announce the 2025-2026 Scholar’s Lab fellows for the Praxis Program and the Graduate Fellowship in the Digital Humanities. We are welcoming 6 fellows from 3 disciplines from the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Our graduate fellows are joining a robust and vibrant community of past students!

## Praxis Program

We are delighted to welcome 5 team members to the 15th (!) year of the Praxis Program, our flagship introduction to digital humanities by way of collaborative, project-based pedagogy:

* Jessica Gomez, (English)
* Ganiyu (Jimga) Jimoh, (Art and Architectural History)
* Eleanor Ma, (Sociology)
* Leo Palma, (Art and Architectural History)
* Adnan Zarif, (English)

Look forward to more details about the Praxis Program’s work in the fall!

## Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities

Finally, we are looking forward to working with Seanna Viechweg, our 2025-2026 Graduate Fellow in the Digital Humanities.

*	Seanna Viechweg's (English) dissertation is titled "Dougla Dreaming: Afro-Indo-Caribbean Hybridity, Memory, and Worldmaking from
Realist to Speculative Narratives"

Seanna will work with our team throughout the year and over the summer on substantial research projects related to her dissertation. She joins a vibrant community of students working in the lab in the coming year.

Special thanks to everyone who served on the application committees that selected these fantastic students. We are looking forward to working with all of them in the coming year!
