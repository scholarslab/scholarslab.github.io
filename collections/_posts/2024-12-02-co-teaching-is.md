Co-teaching is a promise. To each other. To yourself. To believe. To trust. To support. To help. To heal. 

Co-teaching is not a weapon. Co-teaching is a gift. 

Co-teaching is an act of love. It is not a competition 

Co-teaching is not a zero sum game. 

Co-teaching is to see the world through the eyes of another. The classroom. Yourself. 

Co-teaching is an act of vulnerability. To teach is to expose yourself. 

Co-teaching is to invite someone in. 

Co-teaching is an act of empathy. 

Co-teaching is to extend your arms openly. It is not pushing someone away. 

Co-teaching is a beautiful game. It is not a game of chance. 

To teach is to learn. To co-teach is to learn to teach.

Co-teaching is embracing the unknown. To find yourself in the shoes of another.

To co-teach is to recognize that you have power.
