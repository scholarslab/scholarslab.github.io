title: "Building Folkloric Futures: A Behind-The-Scenes Look At Designing A Speculative Digital Archive Of Caribbean Storytelling"
category: essay
---
What would it mean to design a digital archive that doesn’t simply preserve the past, but actively looks both backward and forward—one that helps us think differently about how the past and future speak to each other?

This question kept coming up as I began building **Folkloric Futures**, an Omeka-based digital archive that brings together Caribbean folklore, literature, visual art, and community storytelling. From the beginning, I knew I didn’t want to create an archive that treated folkloric figures as static artifacts or neatly categorized traditions. These stories are alive. They change depending on who tells them, where they’re told, and why they’re remembered.

Folkloric Futures started as a way to test that idea in practice.

I’m a PhD candidate in English at the University of Virginia, and my academic research focuses on Caribbean literature and speculative storytelling. My dissertation looks at how folkloric Caribbean figures like the soucouyant, douen, jumbie, and moko jumbie move across novels, oral traditions, and visual culture—and how those movements shape ideas about identity, belonging, and survival. But I kept asking myself a bigger question: *what would it look like to take those ideas out of a dissertation and build something people could actually explore, use, and contribute to?*

This project is my attempt to answer that.

## Why folklore—and why speculation?

There’s a line from Martinican writer Patrick Chamoiseau that I return to often: *“Their eyes had seen so much that they no longer distinguished between dream and reality”* (from *Creole Folktales*). For me, that line captures what folklore does best. These stories don’t offer neat explanations of the past; they give people ways to live alongside it.

Caribbean folkloric figures are full of contradictions. The soucouyant is frightening, but also powerful—an older woman who sheds her skin and moves through the night as fire. The douen is a child spirit who lingers at the edge of the forest, both vulnerable and unsettling. The moko jumbie towers above the crowd during Carnival, part guardian, part performer. These figures carry history in ways that are felt rather than explained—through fear, humor, warning, and care.

Speculation gives me a way to work with that complexity. Instead of asking, *“What is this figure?”* speculation asks, *“What can this figure do?”* What stories does it carry? What futures does it hint at? What happens if we design an archive that allows those meanings to shift rather than settle?

## Designing an archive that tells stories

At a basic level, Folkloric Futures is a digital archive built in Omeka. It brings together literary excerpts, oral histories, visual art, and creative reinterpretations of Caribbean folklore. But very quickly, I realized that the hardest part of the project wasn’t collecting materials—it was deciding how the archive should feel.

Most digital archives aim for visual consistency and neutrality. This one couldn’t. These figures don’t belong to a single mood, palette, or structure. So instead of designing one uniform template, I let each figure shape its own page.

The soucouyant’s page uses deep violets and ember-like gradients to suggest heat, night, and movement. The douen’s page is quieter, built around forest greens and shadow, echoing stories of childhood loss and ecological liminality. The moko jumbie’s page is bright and vertical, drawing on the energy of Carnival and the figure’s role as a watcher from above.

These choices aren’t just aesthetic. They’re a way of letting design do some of the storytelling work—guiding how people encounter each figure before they ever read a word.

## Metadata, but make it human

Metadata turned out to be one of the most surprising parts of this project.

Folkloric figures don’t stay in one place. Their names change across islands, and their meanings shift between generations. Trying to force them into fixed categories felt like losing what mattered most about them. So instead of treating metadata as a rigid checklist, I started treating it as something closer to a set of prompts.

Instead of asking only where a figure comes from, the archive makes room for multiple origins. It doesn’t settle on a single interpretation, but allows overlapping themes and contradictions to sit side by side. In this way, metadata becomes another storytelling layer—one that reflects how folklore actually moves through the world.

## Ethics as something you build in, not add later

Because Folkloric Futures works with living traditions, ethics could not be an afterthought. Early on, I wrote a project charter to guide decisions about collaboration, credit, and care.

That meant committing to a few core ideas:

- contributors are collaborators, not data sources  
- artists deserve material compensation  
- people should control how their stories are shared  
- accessibility matters, especially for oral and low-bandwidth storytelling  

These principles shape everything from submission forms to design choices. Ethics, in this project, isn’t a separate section—it’s part of the infrastructure.

## Teaching as part of the archive

Folkloric Futures is also a teaching project. In Spring 2026, I’ll be running a workshop series that invites participants to experiment with archives, oral storytelling, mapping, and creative worldmaking—using both digital tools and low-tech alternatives.

The goal isn’t technical mastery—every workshop includes a low-tech version by design. It’s about helping people see archives as places where stories can be questioned and expanded. In this way, teaching feeds back into the archive, and the archive becomes something shaped by ongoing learning rather than a finished authority.

## What building in public has taught me

Working on this project has changed how I think about archives. I’ve learned that design decisions are never neutral, that aesthetics shape interpretation, and that building in public requires patience, iteration, and accountability.

Most of all, it’s reinforced my belief that speculation isn’t escapism. In Caribbean storytelling, imagination is often a survival strategy—a way of carrying history forward without being trapped by it. Folkloric Futures tries to honor that by creating a digital space that doesn’t just preserve stories, but invites people to think with them.

Because an archive, at its best, doesn’t just hold the past. It helps people live with it.
