My cohort just finished our second week of Praxathon and I wanted to reflect on the development of our project and how we ended up focusing on conducting text analysis of the UVa students’ satirical publication, *The Yellow Journal*. 

For me, this project started back in 2018 when I was accepted into *The Yellow Journal* as a second year undergraduate student at UVa. *The Yellow Journal* is an anonymously-published satirical newspaper that has operated on and off since 1913. Undergraduate students know *The Yellow Journal* for its members’ semesterly tradition of disrupting libraries during the first day of finals by raucously distributing the publication while masked and wearing all yellow… and often blasting *Yellow* by Coldplay or *Black and Yellow* by Wiz Khalifa on giant speakers. I started my tenure as a satirical writer with the headline and article below: 

> **Hardest Part of Getting Accepted into the Comm School is Needing to Replace All of Your Friends, Student Says**

> As the season of applying to the McIntire School of Commerce approaches for second years, older students reflect on their prior application experiences. Kody, a fourth year in the Comm school, explains that the application itself was easy; he had no doubt in his mind that he would get in. The hardest part was letting go of all of his non-Comm friends afterwards. “I just can’t let failure into my life,” Kody explains. “Once you’re in the Comm School, you have to start setting standards for your friends, and most of my friends weren’t meeting mine.” Kody was on the fence about keeping his Batten friends, but eventually decided against it. “Hanging out with them is bad for optics, in my opinion,” Kody stated. “While Batten kids are also good at networking, I can’t let their morals get in my way. They’re all about government intervention… hey dummies, what about the invisible hand?” Drew, an Economics major, elaborates on his ended friendship with Kody: “The minute my roommate Kody got accepted, he turned to me and asked me to move out. I was heartbroken, we had been living together since first year. In fact, he’s also my cousin. But I understand… it had to be done.” Drew wasn’t sure if it was worth it to even continue college after his rejection from Comm. To him, having no diploma at all is better than getting an non-Comm Economics degree.

Outside of writing headlines and articles, *Yellow Journal* members were also in the midst of digitizing and archiving the entire history of the paper on our Google Drive. The publication started in 1913, but it was only published regularly starting in 1920 and then was subsequently banned in 1934 by the UVa administration due to its anonymity. The publication then resumed in 1987, having its own office next to *The Cavalier Daily* with a modest amount of revenue from selling ad placements. The paper was discontinued again in 1999, but a group of students revived it in 2010 which resulted in its current, ongoing iteration. 

In late 2019, I realized that we were approaching 100 years since *The Yellow Journal* was published regularly and I applied to a few grants that could possibly fund a special anniversary issue. I wanted to use the extensive archive work that members had so painstakingly organized for future members to look back on. The idea was to publish some highlights from our archive, especially the jokes that still remained relevant today. With quarantine in March 2020, however, interest from my collaborators waned and I eventually abandoned that project. I knew that I wanted to return to working on a project about *The Yellow Journal* someday because it provided such unique insight on the student experience of the University. Also, even 100 years later, many of the early issues are still *so funny*.

My position as a former member of *The Yellow Journal* was definitely the reason that the subject was brought up as a possible topic for our Praxathon, but I don’t think this project would have necessarily worked with other cohorts. The final section on [our charter](https://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/charter-2024-2025/) is titled “Make Learning a Playful Process.” That was a big goal of our cohort: to approach the work in a fun, lighthearted way. I wasn’t completely sure about the viability of that pledge when we first wrote the charter. I didn’t know the rest of my cohort well at the time and I was still very operating in “traditional graduate classroom” mode. As we are approaching the end of the year, however, I think I can now safely say that we made every single part of Praxis fun and playful. I spend a good portion of my time in Praxis attempting to stifle my laughter at Oriane’s 10,000 things to commit to Github, Shane’s river drawing, or Brandon attempts to find new phrases because we accidentally made him insecure about saying “for what it’s worth.”

When I first pitched *The Yellow Journal* as an idea for Praxathon, I was mainly thinking about how it made sense as a project in a practical way: we already had access to high quality digitized records of all of the issues. The scope seemed manageable and it did not require too much preparatory work. As we’ve progressed in the project, I’ve slowly realized why it resonated with us as a group beyond logistics. Since we’re all graduate students at UVa, we are all familiar with and invested in the University’s history (especially told from a student perspective). We want to have fun with the material, which has led to many instances of us sitting in the fellows lounge and reading funny headlines out loud to each other. 

Most of all, I think that the way we’ve developed the project has played into our individual and collective strengths. I never even thought about looking at student records from the 1920s and 30s but Gramond, being an incredible historian and lover of data, introduced us to that possibility. Oriane has done some amazing research on the history of the University at the time period that we’re looking at and, more generally, on analyzing satire. Because of her research of poetry, Amna was already interested in many of the text analysis methods that we’re using so she has expertly led us in thinking about how to apply those to *The Yellow Journal*.  Kristin, as always, has shown herself to be an amazing problem solver, ready to tackle any coding task with such resolve and creativity. I just love assigning tasks to people so I have commandeered our Trello board. 

Our poster will hopefully be done in the next few weeks, but it is clear to me now that the process, or journey, through the Praxathon is much more important than the end product. As I read through our charter again, I realize how true to our goals we’ve been and how interdisciplinary (and fun!) our final project is.
