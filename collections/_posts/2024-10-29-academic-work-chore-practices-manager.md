_(Part 3 of a 3-part series: see also [the 1st post](https://literaturegeek.com/2024/10/22/academic-work-chore-hacks-email) on email practices and some caveats about my particular academic job context, and [the 2nd post](https://literaturegeek.com/2024/10/28/academic-work-chore-hacks-slack-tasks-meeting-notes) on Slack, task management, meeting notes.)_

My previous two blog posts shared some of the ways I approach "work chores" (email, Slack, tasks) to keep them more sustainable. In this third post, I wanted to share a bit about how I try to do things as a manager/director re:similar expectations-impacted work-chore practices, so that my colleagues in the lab can also try or use the approaches to work that work best for them.

## Not just asking about work sustainability; offering to act
As a manager, I try to regularly check in: Do you have time blocked out for focus, work-chores, time off? But I try to not only ask "are you doing these theoretically useful approaches"; I also want to discuss if the person needs those or wants something different; what is making it difficult to use these or other work-management approaches; what can we do to make this all more sustainable. Do you need actions from me/other colleagues to support that, e.g. changing deadlines, moving or cancelling meetings, changing communication formats (emails, Slack, meetings), notes from a meeting you can't make? If you're going to ask if people have time blocked out for needed things like focus and time off, being prepared with possible ways to help if they don't makes sense.

## Where expectations are needed, make them as loose as possible
As a manager, I try to make space for others to figure out the what, when, how of the practices that work best for them. To do this, I try to communally discuss and set agreements on what outcomes are critical (e.g. impact colleagues and people we support) and which are nice to have; and to let folks know they can question and advocate for something different these expectations, which are often ultimately somewhat arbitrary (e.g. why answer most emails within 2 workdays rather than 3 or 4?). I try to keep expectations as high-level and brief as possible—setting these as what's fine for us to generally at least meet, rather than what's ideal (but not required to happen all the time—or at all, if doing so impedes other work/focus/non-work time). And I try to talk about my reasoning for expectations, since that can often be useful context (e.g. something that isn't a big issue if 1 person does it, but I ask for because I have not 1 but 10 full-time staff reporting through me, so effect of approach x multiple people may be a big issue) or allow my colleague to suggest alternatives that still meet my goals while also meeting theirs.

For example, when responding to our lab's consult listserv, we want people to feel welcomed and know they've contacted folks who will get them to the right place, even if that isn't ultimately the lab. We do also balance a lot of consultations against longer projects, teaching, fieldwork, events, etc., and try to set public expectations of our availability for consultations as usually 2-3 weeks out from original email date (though we can meet faster when there's an urgent need). So our expectation is that we try to have someone on staff reply to any initial message requesting a consultation with us, to us within two workdays if possible; but that reply can simply be "thanks for your message; we're discussing internally, and will get back you with more by [DATE]" if needed. This is useful when an ask requires us to talk to colleagues in different units about a project's history, ID whether anyone has some specific software experience, and/or when multiple relevant staff across units might all be available to attend a consultation together. 

This meets our goals of making sure the person contacting us feels welcomed and knows we'll be helping them, but also does not require staff to constantly check or reply to email. As with my post on personal email/etc. approaches, we often reply to folks within the same day! But setting the minimum bar higher is good for making sure folks can set boundaries on email management, and also get non-email work done.

I try to emphasize communication over conformance: it's okay if you need more time, need to change plans, etc. But the way you make this not adversely impact colleagues is by communicating as early as possible when you need a change and why. (E.g. if you're repeatedly asking for extensions after deadlines pass instead of well before, it could be a sign that deadlines are being set too soon, you have too much work, or something else we should work on making more sustainable.)

## Look for ways to support others' needs
We know other Library colleagues sometimes have in-person, or urgent questions from visitors for us. While protecting time to do the kinds of focused work we're tasked with (and acknowledging we're not staffed to have someone guaranteed available and able to drop their work at any time for unscheduled non-emergency drop-ins), we've got several approaches to staying available to other Library staff, including:
* Our consult listserv goes to our whole team of 12 people, so even if each person is only checking email once a day (not the norm), when that happens would vary enough we're getting someone seeing incoming emails who can usually note if something's urgent.
* We use Slack a bunch, and its notification settings make it easy for us to find each other and ask for a quicker reply, when one's actually needed.
* We've set "core staff hours" when it's most likely you can find a free staffer somewhere in the lab, and shared these with library circulation desks; as well as non-public, broader core times when at least several of us are physically in the lab and findable if needed.

Ultimately, we are privileged to encounter few work-related emergencies (e.g. site is down before a conference talk about it; water is leaking into the makerspace; short-notice funding possibility). We try to make our availability and response practices clear, so folks know how and when they can find us.
