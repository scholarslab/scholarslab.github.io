Please join us in the Scholars' Lab at noon on Tuesday, September 9th, as we introduce our new [Graduate Fellows in Digital Humanities](http://www.scholarslab.org/about/fellowship.html) as part of our first "Digital Therapy" Faculty and Grad Luncheon of the semester.

With projects in social networking, geospatial analysis, and cultural mapping, these three doctoral candidates -- Jean Bauer of the History Department, Pierre Dairon of the French Department, and Abigail Holeman of the Anthropology Department -- are applying exciting new methods to the study of early American history, French literature, and Mesoamerican cosmology. Each will speak briefly about his or her research, and a free lunch will be served.
