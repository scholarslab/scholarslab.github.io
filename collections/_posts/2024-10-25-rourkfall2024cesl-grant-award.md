[Will Rourk](/people/will-rourk) successfully proposed a UVA Engage grant sending funds to Charlottesville's The Haven day shelter (located in a historic church) & local nonprofit Doing Good. He recently 3D scanned the building in support of restoration and improvement efforts to better serve unhoused neighbors.
