What do [obscure Gen-X movie references](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz95y3gLNA4) have to do with GIS workshops?  Nothing at all, just go with it. 

Ah Spring! Plenty of cliches that could go here, about renewal and growth perhaps, but not really fitting as most of these sessions occur during the icy depths of winter. Regardles, it's a good enough time for us to shift gears and turn our workshop focus to ArcGIS Online (AGOL), Esri's GIS solution for the cloud. AGOL is browser-based, eliminating any Windows vs. Mac shenanigans, and allowing us to provide temporary access to members of the community that don't have UVA credentials. 

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM** and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. Late-comers are welcome and encouraged, registration will remain open until the conclusion of the workshop. Use the links below to register and get a Zoom link. Yeah, I know, Zoom-fatigue and all that. We're gonna do virtual one last time, then we will be moving to a hybrid setup for next Fall. If you're sick of virtual, but want to put a positive spin on things, you are experiencing the end of an era. Exciting, right?

**January 31st - Introduction to ArcGIS Online**

ArcGIS Online is the cloud-based younger sibling of ArcGIS Pro. It can't do some of the less flashy, GISy kind of things, but it's in the cloud, it's connected, which adds all the hip functionality we've come to expect. With ArcGIS Online, you can find and create spatial data, maps, and applications. Access a limited but powerful set of analysis tools that take advantage of cloud computing and pre-configured data and resources. Share and collaborate with small groups or with the world. It's an easy-to-use entry into the world of GIS, all from the comfort of your browser.

**February 14th - Collect Data in the Field**

Whether you are crowd sourcing spatial data or performing survey work, having an application that records location and uploads data directly to a mapping application is incredibly useful.

**February 28th - Spatial Analysis with ArcGIS Online**

Perform basic analysis with tools like Buffer and Spatial Join. Or, enhance your data, taking advantage of the always up-to-date elevation, streets, and demographics data available in ArcGIS Online with tools like Create Viewshed, Find Nearest, and Enrich. Come for the learning and stay for stories about the old days when we had to create all that data ourselves. Uphill. Both ways!!

Enjoy a break. We'll see you next week!

**March 13th -  Instant Apps and More**

Dip your toes into the world of web GIS applications with AGOL's quick-configure app builders. We'll explore a few of the many options for enriching your map and data with focused applications. From time animation to interactive multimedia, these easy-to-use templates and builders take your data to the next level.

**March 20th - App Your Map with Experience Builder**

Continuing with the app theme, we'll go beyond templates into custom application creation. Would you like to make a custom online mapping application without having to code? We would, and do. ArcGIS Experience Builder allows users of all levels to drag and drop tools to create responsive mapping applications, from simple to expansive.
