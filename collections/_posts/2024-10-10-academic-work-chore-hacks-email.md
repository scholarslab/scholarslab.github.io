I'm sharing some approaches to work chores (email, Slack, etc.) that are currently working for me. This is another ["my SLab colleague told me I should write a post about this" post](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/discussion-that-opens/)—thanks to Brandon Walsh for suggesting I make some of my more personally-successful work-chore practices (which I periodically have shared with various staff, when asked) into a public post. I've found it most useful to try out small changes at a time, not huge swerves among different systems of task management.

## Short version, pls
_tl;dr_ of the hacks detailed below and on subsequent posts in this series: 
1. Have a daily email/message triage time, putting those messages that can wait for reading/reply until a weekly email catchup time, into a folder to attend to then. 
2. Block that weekly catchup time on your calendar, preferably the same time each week, at a time you won't struggle to put aside other work to finish going through those emails (e.g. I do it first thing Friday mornings).
3. Use: Outlook rules to divert low-priority emails and highlight high-priority emails; Slack "save for later" and "remind me about this" (_not_ "mark unread"); a task manager that supports recurring tasks.

## Some caveats
This is a very "your mileage might vary" post; this doctor is not saying whether these approaches are right for you. Directing a library-based DH research center means my workday involves a variety of communications (e.g. Workday notifications, budget reports, sending many recurring meeting invites to various groups) that make it more useful to have a more formal system for balancing them against focused work time, as do my own particular work habits and neurodivergence. (FWIW, I am very much an Always Inbox Zero, Task App: Too-Many person.)

I also recognize my privilege in having the job type, security, supervision level, accessibility accommodations, and more that mean I get to make these choices. Some workplaces have invasive policies about when, how, how often; some jobs actually need you to be checking or replying to communications as they come in; some teams would be negatively impacted by someone not checking messages as often as the group truly needs. Different jobs have different needs and/or culture regarding what goes into email, Slack, recurring meetings, or ad hoc conversations. 

In particular, the part about how often I check my email felt a bit fraught to share, especially without sharing more context about accessibility. But it's made a significant improvement in how well I can focus, make progress, maintain work boundaries and sustainability, as well as do well by my colleagues—so I wanted to share it, even if it isn't necessarily something everyone else can implement as described. (Part two of this blog post will discuss how I try to accommodate similar practices for my colleagues, as a manager/director).

Ultimately, I try to balance two things:
* being able to get to the kinds of focused work that are part of my job, without interruption (unless something is truly an emergency)
* responding to messages within a reasonable timeframe, and having a triage system keeping my inbox manageable so I can more easily see if a colleague sends an urgent-response-needed message

## Some approaches that work for me, right now

### Email management
I use a daily triage practice, plus a weekly block for catching up on reading/replying to things that can wait until then:
* I have a daily time when I’m always free (5-30min?), that I block for managing email (Outlook is what UVA uses for staff). I put this daily email time as a recurring hold on my calendar until it became habit, and now I just do it first thing, before any meetings.
* I have a “process today” email folder; when this daily email time happens, I dump everything currently in my inbox into “process today”. I don’t _require_ myself to look at my inbox again until the following day, unless\* I’m done with all my other work and feel like it.
  * This helps me not get caught up answering constantly incoming stuff, which can usually wait a bit, and get to older reading/replies first.
  * \* In practice, I _do_ actually check my work email several times per workday. I try not to do so until I've both done that initial transfer to the "process today" folder, and until I've processed that "process today" folder (as described below). This means that any other emails I get to are a bonus, so they don't carry the same feeling of "I'm behind until I clear this from my inbox". 
* Emails that can wait until my weekly “catch up on work chores” block (Friday mornings) get moved to a “Brain Day” folder.
    * This keeps my inbox more manageable, so I can more easily visually skim it between meetings to notice if someone does have an urgent and/or easy-to-answer question
* I try to reply to everything else in the "process today" folder during that daily time, even if it’s just to say “I received this, but it’ll be [a couple days] before I will have a more substantive response”. I send that kind of message if I'm not sure I'll get to something (better to followup up sooner than promised, than to forget to respond).

### "Brain Day" for weekly work chores
I use a weekly, scheduled catchup block ("Brain Day"):
* During “Brain Day”, I catch up on all emails I moved to the "Brain Day" folder during the week—the ones that could wait to be read (including non-urgent FYI things, newsletters), and emails I told people I’d need more time to reply to. 
* If I can’t finish working through all my email then, I block time to do so the following week (rare/ugh).

After completing email catchup, I also use that "Brain Day" block to do other weekly or monthly recurring work chores, like updating our budget, planning what tasks I'm doing the following week, and prepping for the next week's meetings.

### Other email hacks
I use Outlook rules to:
* route stuff that I mostly only need to skim or can wait to read until my weekly “Brain Day” (e.g. from our "general announcements to all Library staff" listserv, which tends to more "here's an interesting webinar" and less "urgent info to read today") into the “Brain Day” folder, so I don’t have to look at it nor manually sort it until Fridays
* route stuff I need to get to sooner (e.g. emails to the SLab consult listserv; emails from SLab staff, supervisors) into a place I’ll see them easily
* Move some sent emails to a “Waiting to hear” folder, if I need to make sure I do hear back a response (vs. assuming someone will definitely write back); I check this during weekly “Brain Day” to see if I need to ping anyone about a non-response (when enough time has gone by)

I don't currently need this, but if staying out of your inbox is hard because you need to notice specific things: I used to use USB LEDs called [Blink(1)s](https://blink1.thingm.com/) to alert me to things I wanted to notice. For me, that was during my dissertation's Infinite Ulysses open beta, when I wanted to know when someone created a new account on my digital edition, or posted an annotation. But you could hook these up to IFTTT or Zapier and have specific combinations of person and text on Slack or Outlook trigger the light turning on, or blinking in a pattern. (I can't use sound notifications—if you can, you can of course set up Slack/Outlook to make a noise for certain things, though I think this isn't granular down to e.g. "make this sound if x person pings me"?)

The next two posts will deal with Slack, task management, and meeting notes; and handling expectations vs. healthy work practices, as a manager.
