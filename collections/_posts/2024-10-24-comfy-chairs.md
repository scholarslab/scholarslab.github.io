We're already more than a week into October (!), and recently I have been reflecting on my first month in the Praxis program. In just a few weeks, I have learned so many new things and had the opportunity to practice new skills! I’m so glad to be a part of this community and can’t wait to see how the rest of the year unfolds. 

One of my favorite things about Praxis is the environment. In addition to being highly knowledgeable and skilled, everyone on the Scholars’ Lab staff is kind, welcoming, and supportive. I always feel at ease during Praxis meetings, even if we are covering a challenging or confusing topic. I am comfortable admitting when I don’t understand something, which is a huge help because that has always been difficult for me to do. Everyone is so helpful, patient, and understanding, and I appreciate that so much.

There are some features of the Scholars’ Lab that may seem like not a big deal, but that make a real difference for me. One is the abundance of comfy chairs and couches! Having a variety of options for doing work really helps me - when I work at home, I frequently move from the desk chair to the couch, and then to the bar stools at the counter, and then back to the couch, and…you get the point. Early on in our Praxis sessions, we were seated around the table when I looked over and noticed all the comfy chairs nearby. I asked whether we could try those out for a session, and Brandon immediately said yes! Now we have been doing all of our sessions there. I’m of course flexible and would be happy to sit wherever anyone wanted to, but it makes me happy to know that the Scholars’ Lab staff is aware of differences in work styles and open to trying out new arrangements. (The coffee from Shane and the snacks from Jeremy are huge perks too!) 

I think one of the greatest strengths of Praxis is the diversity of experience and interests within our cohort. We represent five different departments and bring a variety of academic and personal experiences to our time together. It has been so enjoyable to hear about others’ research and learn completely new ways of looking at things. I’m also excited for us to work on collaborative projects together. First up is the 2024-2025 charter, which we’re all working on right now! The charter is a great exercise for us, since it not only helps us to get to know each other better but also serves as a way for us to dive right into collaborative work. 

Finally, in just a few short weeks, I have already had the opportunity to explore several new tools that will help me to grow collaboratively and in my own graduate school work. These tools will enable me to approach work and the creative process in new and refreshing ways. It is exciting to learn from the Scholars’ Lab staff, whose combined expertise encompasses many DH tools and exhibits both breadth and depth.

The Praxis program has so far been a unique and nurturing experience for which I am grateful. There is lots to explore - the Scholars’ Lab space, the Makerspace, and much more! I’m already enjoying everything at this early stage in the semester, and I can’t wait to grow alongside my Praxis cohort. As Buzz Lightyear says, “To Infinity and Beyond!”
