I've got a conference poster at [DH 2025](https://dh2025.adho.org/) this week, and since I needed to attend remotely and things being what they are, I went all out on making the design Very Extra and much in the spirit of this site's design :) Enjoy!

![Screenshot of Amanda Wyatt Visconti (that's me) poster for the Digital Humanities 2025 conference in Portugal happening later this week. The poster has a lot of color going on: a border of zine covers, at least 7 rainbows not counting the rainbow-leopard-print border around the Zine Bakery zine-toaster-rainbow logo, lime green text on bright purple, magenta arrows, etc. The poster's intro text says "Zine Bakery / Author: Dr. Amanda Wyatt Visconti / Project Website: ZineBakery.com / Exploring zines for DH research, methods training, & scholarly communication. You might be picturing zines as their 20th-century origins: collaged, xeroxed, free paper booklets on subcultures, social justice, marginalized experiences; or their earliest precursors, like the "little magazines" of the Harlem Renaissance. But today, creators make
"zines" varying widely in format, from 100+ page tiny books to digital-only creative websites. Content varies widely: comics, tutorials, scholarly or personal essays, collage, creative writing, news, & more. However they look, most zines stay true to the form's original vision of radically low barrier authoring, publication, dissemintation, & reading. Zines are a welcoming, inexpensive, and effective format for do-it-yourself scholarly communication, friendly teaching of digital research methods, and public humanities outreach - as well as an opportunity for data analysis and other DH explorations. The Zine Bakery (ZineBakery.com) is a digital humanities project collecting, amplifying, researching, & authoring zines, with an emphasis on free, resharable zines & zines about culture, tech, & justice." The poster goes on to share some stats about the zines in the catalog, list the different parts of the research, and give an overview of how zines are useful for urgent advocacy.](/assets/post-media/2025-07-16-dh2025-zinebakery-poster/ViscontiAmandaWyatt-DH2025Poster-ImageVersion.jpg)
