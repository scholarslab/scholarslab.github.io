My son is learning to talk. He's also become obsessed with trucks through no doing of our own. These little Lego toys snap together but just as easily come apart. "Bo!!" is a common refrain heard throughout our house followed by frantic running in our direction. He will drop a bundle of pieces in your lap and shift in place in front of you saying, "Fee!!"

Each time, I take them in hand and snap a few things back in place. He giggles and runs away, and I know he'll be back soon. These days the process repeats itself several times an hour. 

"Bo!! Fee!!"

The world is full of pain and wanton cruelty right now, and it all feels like too much. But when my son comes running with a problem I at least know what to do. Broken? Fix. It won't work for all things, but it can work for some.

Find the one person you can help. Fix the one thing. I'll keep repeating that to myself.
