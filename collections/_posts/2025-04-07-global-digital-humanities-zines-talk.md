I presented about the Zine Bakery this spring at the Global Digital Humanities conference, and as an invited speaker at the Cal Poly Humboldt Library's Innovation Summit. Below are some links that had to fly by on my screen, so folks have more time to peruse them!

I'm on Bluesky at [LiteratureGeek.bsky.social](https://LiteratureGeek.bsky.social) if you want to chat there!
