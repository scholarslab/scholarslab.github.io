I've a talk accepted to the [2026 Global DH conference](https://msuglobaldh.org/), and share that proposal here both for its content and as another example of what a conference abstract can look like. I've added comments (in '''code formatting''') highlighting how the abstract proposal is structured.

## *"Not having to ask: critical humanities making, zines, & analog tech for multilingual DH"*

In ["Having to Ask"](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/having-to-ask/), a doctoral colleague [2024-2025 Praxis Fellow [Amna Irfan Tarar](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/people/amna-irfan-tarar/)] writes about othering experiences in DH spaces, such as when staff weren't sure if a web font used by a team project could correctly render her name in Urdu. I'm developing digital and analog letterpress resources as part of our DH center's critical humanities makerspace studies. Letterpress moveable type is a pre-digital corollary to multilingual web fonts, and Tarar's essay reinforced my priority of anyone printing with us being able to print their name—without singling out that name as needing special effort or research. 

<code>Motivation / underlying research question.</code>

This lightning talk covers the DH work I've started toward this goal, and will be of interest to scholars curious about: zine creation for teaching, critical humanities making, multilingual DH, accessibility, book arts, and connections between historical/retro tech and current DH methods. I'll share my first set of moveable non-English type, my forthcoming zine on how to inexpensively create similar type, and an overview of my research into historical and current strategies for fabricating non-Latin type (some of which cannot be segmented into easily interoperable rectangles the way Latin type can). I know there are too many languages for us to complete this goal; while slowly moving toward that vision language by language, I'm also developing some quick hacks to at least slightly improve type accessibility in the mean time, as well as working to replicate how such scripts were historically printed.

<code>Specifics on what the talk will cover. Which scholars might want to attend it and why, including showing how that's not limited to e.g. "people who do letterpress" or "makerspace people". Quick note that I understand the most immediate likely challenges to this work.</code>

I've wanted to contribute to a more multilingual DH, despite my monolingual ability restricting what I can do. My hope is to develop enough type design and fabrication competency to partner with colleagues who have greater language competency than me, and I'm eager to hear advice from session attendees toward this goal.

<code>Where is this in-progress research headed, and how might that benefit others? What kind of Q&A might this talk elicit from its audience?</code>
