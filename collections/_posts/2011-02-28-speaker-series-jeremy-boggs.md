Jeremy Boggs, last semester's scholar-in-residence at the [Scholars' Lab](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab), will give a talk at **2pm** on Thursday, **March 3**. Boggs is Associate Director of Research at the [Center for History & New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu) at George Mason University, as well as a Ph.D. candidate in GMU's Department of History.

During his tenure at CHNM, where he was a founding member of the [THATCamp](http://thatcamp.org/) movement, Boggs has been deeply involved in developing conversations about the definition of Digital Humanities and how best to prepare scholars to work on digital projects. His Scholars' Lab talk, entitled **A Plea for Open Digital Humanities Work: or, A DH Grad Student Reflects on Years of 'Study'**, argues that defining a canonical set of skills for digital humanists is ultimately a fruitless endeavor. Instead, Boggs urges the development and promotion of digital humanities tools that are open, well-documented, and learnable, allowing scholars to create projects from these tools that carry these same characteristics. If the digital humanities community can promote a culture of open projects and toolsets, scholars will be able to explore and expand their skills by learning from collleagues' work.

[Dr. Bethany Nowviskie](http://nowviskie.org) will act as respondent for this talk.
