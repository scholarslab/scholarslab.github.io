The Scholars’ Lab, part of the Digital Humanities Center in the University of Virginia Library, is accepting proposals for creative works that tell evocative, artistic, and thought-provoking stories with data for display in our community space (Shannon Library, Room 308).

We use "data art" rather than "data visualization" to emphasize we seek physical, compelling, data-inspired or data-enriched compositions that inspire or educate visitors. These can be, but *do not need* to be large-scale research projects. They *should be* based on some kind of specific data, but we define data broadly to include analog, ephemeral  "data" such as photo albums, archives, and personal records, as well as digital datasets. Projects should take a material form—that visitors to our space can examine and/or interact with. They can be graphical (2D) or multidimensional exhibits, and can also incorporate sound or other analog or digital media. 

**Questions or need help IDing data?** If you have a clear idea for exploring a specific topic with a specific artistic outcome, but need help identifying a dataset to use, we might be able to suggest possibilities. Please email [Laura Miller](lam2c@virginia.edu) at least a week before the application is due to set up a data consultation, or to answer any other questions you may have.

## Eligibility:

* Applicants must be at least 18 years old, can work independently or in collaborative groups, and do not need to be affiliated with UVA. There is no travel or residential funding associated with this award, but virtual participation and presentation is required if you are not local.

## Prize:

The inaugural 2025-26 award will be $1,000: of that amount, up to $300 is available as soon as the project is accepted for the purchase of materials needed for the fabrication of the exhibit, with the remainder provided to the creator (if UVA student or non-UVA affiliate) or their department (if UVA faculty or staff) after the finished project is delivered to the Lab, and the public event is complete. 

* The selected work(s) will be on loan to the Library and will be displayed for the academic year (August-May).  The work will be returned to the artist at the conclusion of the term. 
* The Library will provide assistance transporting, installing, and labeling the piece. 
* The Scholars’ Lab will host an opening reception, with a brief talk, and will aid in programming around the piece in conjunction with the artist.  Local creator events will take place in person; travel funds are not available, so non-local creators will speak virtually.

## Space considerations:

The Scholars’ Lab Common Room (Shannon 308) space has:
* **one area** with available two-dimensional installation space up to **up to 56” w by 88” h** or a three-dimensional installation space **up to 56” w by 48” d by 120” h**.
* **a second area** with a two-dimensional installation space of **up to 84” w by 88” h** or a three-dimensional installation space **up to 48” w by 48” d by 120” h**. 
* **a third area** with a three-dimensional space of **up to 72” w by 72”d by 120” h**.
Ideally the installation would use one of these three locations, but if your project design utilizes multiple spaces, please indicate this in your proposal. Note: all completed projects must either be assembled on site or pass through our main entrance, measuring **72” w by 88” h**.


## Proposal Requirements:

* Project title
* Brief bio of the artist(s) focused on what prepares you for this work. Please include any previous experience with the method (e.g. quilting, sculpting, weaving, felting, electronics, etc.) used to complete your project.
* Either an artistic plan for the work; or if it already exists, link to a website hosting the entry; or, if a physical object, videos or photographs of the completed piece
  * Description of the work, including material, finished size, technical specifications (if digital), and installation requirements
* Project explanation, detailing the data source(s), key decisions in visualizing the data, and the primary narrative or argument conveyed (one-page or less)

## Timeline:

* CFP announced April 23, 2025
* **Submission Deadline**:  Submissions should be sent to [Laura Miller](lam2c@virginia.edu) by end of day, **Friday, May 16**. The artist(s) will be notified by **Friday, May 23**.
* **Project Deadline**: The selected piece must be completed and ready to be installed by August 28, 2025.
