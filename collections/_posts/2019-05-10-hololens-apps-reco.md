## Exploration 

  1. [*Magic Window*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/magic-window/9nzcfqjv9vh7?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab)

      Magic Window, created by 4 Fun Studio Inc., offers a choice of seven scenes, including the pyramids, outer space with aliens, a city with fireworks, and more. What’s great about this app is that it assigns different song effects to match the scene. The player can walk near the window to look closer and explore broader angles of the scene that can’t be seen from farther away.
