As I've written in this space before, I'm working on a book project and recently hit a major milestone. I finished developmental editing and initial proofing just last week, and I compiled the whole thing together into a complete manuscript for the first time. I printed the text out for one last proof front to back before I send it out. This means I suddenly have a physical copy of the whole thing for the first time. It's forty pages longer than my dissertation. Exciting! Feels real and substantial. So much so, in fact, that during my 1:1 meeting with Amanda Visconti I slapped the bundle on the table in front of us. 

"Check _this_ out!" 

Amanda is an incredible mentor, collaborator, and friend. They've been hugely supportive of my work, but especially so about my writing process. I knew they would be excited to see the result. What I couldn't expect was that Amanda would take my print manuscript, hold it to their chest, and say, "Thank you so much. Getting this has made my day so much better." I hadn't intended the printed draft as a gift, but I couldn't really take it back after a reaction like that. I went back to my laptop and printed out a second copy for myself to replace the unexpected gift. 

We should all be so lucky as to have friends and mentors who react to our work like this. The moment was especially meaningful to me as somebody who has all the associated anxieties and imposter syndrome about their project not being good enough. It is so easy to see something only for its flaws and not to see the impact it might have on others even with all its messiness. I wasn't ready to share my manuscript with Amanda, but I did so anyway. 

With the world such as it is, I've been thinking a lot about what it's all for. Why do we write? Why do I write? Who is reading? Does any of it really matter? We all hope that our writing can have some sort of impact in the world, but it's so rare to see its effect in a tangible way. The same day, Dr. Emily Friedman [posted to Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/friede.bsky.social/post/3m4xrh4kksk24) about social media as a space where one can find comfort in "the stars of hope on the far horizon, as here night seems without end." Friedman's post resonated so much, in no small part because I find them to be such an inspiring scholar. So often we quietly take hope and inspiration from people that we never meet and they never hear about the effect they've had on us. 

So I share this small moment for others who might be struggling with their own motivation or with their own perception of their work. Whether you see these kinds of reactions or not, your work matters. You matter. Keep writing. You never know who might clutch your manuscript to their chest when they find it. You might be sharing an unexpected gift someone needs.
