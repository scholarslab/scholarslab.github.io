Social media can help you build professional and social community, find jobs, learn from others, share your work, ask questions, and hear about new ideas and projects. After the implosion of multiple other social platforms, the Bluesky platform has become one of the best options to keep accessing those benefits. This video captures a live webinar from May I gave for [the Metropolitan New York Library Council](https://metro.org/), aiming to help library and archives workers considering trying out Bluesky, or who’ve dipped a toe in but not felt comfortable using it yet.

All the resources mentioned in this talk are listed at [tinyurl.com/intro-bluesky](https://tinyurl.com/intro-bluesky). Most useful is my [Bluesky for Academics](https://tinyurl.com/DHBluesky) guide at [tinyurl.com/DHBluesky](https://tinyurl.com/DHBluesky), which remains regularly updated and contains both very-quick cheatsheet and incredibly detailed versions of how to get started understanding Bluesky use for DHers, GLAM folks, and other knowledge work folks. At the end of that guide is a sortable list of "starter packs", feeds, and lists gathering folks to follow on Bluesky around topics like DH, critical tech, expansive making & crafting, queer studies, social justice work, and more.
