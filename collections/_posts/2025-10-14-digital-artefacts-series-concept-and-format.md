## Welcome to My Journey into Africa’s Digital Creative Pulse

Welcome to a space dedicated to exploring the vibrant, experimental, and often overlooked world of African digital arts. This blog is where tradition blends with innovation, and where culture finds new voices through pixels, code, and imagination. From 3D animations rooted in oral folklore to Afrofuturist virtual worlds, Africa’s digital art scene is bold, boundary-pushing, and deeply rooted in layered histories.

Here, I’ll trace stories across generations, highlighting pioneering artists who bridge the gap between analog and digital, as well as contemporary creators whose practices are entirely digital. From groundbreaking artworks and experimental tools to overlooked archives and reimagined traditions, this blog explores the technologies shaping Africa’s creative landscape.

But beyond aesthetics, I’m also interested in how artists use digital media as tools for critique, resistance, and cultural affirmation; whether by challenging systems of power, reframing narratives, or reaffirming community through visual languages. Whether it’s digital painting, NFT culture, interactive installations, or algorithmic art rooted in indigenous worldviews, this blog is where tradition, technology, and transformation converge.

At the core of this project is the Digital Artifacts series. In each post, I’ll highlight a single object, image, tool, or moment that represents the shift from analog to digital, from archive to screen. Sometimes it will be a contemporary artwork. Other times, a screenshot, an exhibition flyer, a quote, or even a forgotten software experiment.

What connects these fragments is a shared question:  
*How are African artists using technology not only to create, but also to communicate, remember, critique, and transform?*

This isn’t just about showcasing digital work — it’s about listening to what these artefacts reveal.

How are they shaping the future?  
And how does the past continue through code?

**Let’s discover!**
