I'm here to cut the ribbon on the [Scholars' Lab](https://scholarslab.org/index.html) blog.

The Scholars' Lab was established two short years ago at [UVA Library](http://library.virginia.edu) as a site for innovation in the humanities and social sciences.  The idea was to combine the resources and expertise of the Library’s successful **Electronic Text** (Etext) and **Geospatial and Statistical Data** (GeoStat) centers with that of UVA's **Research Computing Support Group** in a physical space that promotes collaboration and experimentation.  Now we’re extending the conversations that happen in our offices and in the SLab to a wider forum.

The past two years have seen amazing work by our [Graduate Fellows in Digital Humanities](https://scholarslab.org/about/fellows.html) and by scholars from a variety of disciplines and fields who work in collaboration with our on-site experts.  Over the coming months, we’ll be inviting our Fellows, grad student consultants, [Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff](https://scholarslab.org/consultation/index.html), visiting scholars, and UVA collaborators to share this blog and make it their own.  The substantive (and [CC-licensed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)) posts you'll find here will be vetted to ensure that they represent sound scholarship and are squarely on-topic.  We'll also use this space to share announcements about SLab [events](https://scholarslab.org/about/events.html) and links to interesting and evocative uses of technology in the humanities and social sciences.

We invite you to comment and engage with us here!
