Scholars' Lab, the UVA Library Digital Humanities Center ([DHC](https://library.virginia.edu/dh-center)), and the Data Analytics Center ([DAC](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/service/dac)) are delighted to announce a new fellowship opportunity. The **2025 Data Analytics Center-Digital Humanities Center Fellowship** is open for proposals from UVA faculty and graduate students. This is an experimental iteration encouraging the use of high-performance computing resources in the humanities, as well as identifying digital humanities research and teaching that could benefit from support from DHC and DAC. Possible projects might utilize AI, gaming platforms, imaging tools, geospatial technologies, use of new tools, and more.

The team will consist of one faculty and one graduate student collaborating on humanities research in the University of Virginia. We encourage teams and projects that challenge traditional understanding of digital humanities (or even what has been considered humanities research), involve ethical and philosophical issues raised by new technologies, or explore new opportunities for using high-performance computing tools and techniques to better understand the human record.

The award will include guidance and training from DHC and DAC staff and technical expertise and training, along with discussion and planning for the intellectual and technical aspects of the project. At the end of the two-year period, the project team will produce a final report and lessons learned assessment for future collaborations between digital humanities and high-performance computing practitioners. The student will be additionally asked to present a poster of their research at the UVA Research Computing Exhibitions in April 2026 and April 2027 and to prepare a workshop, tutorial, or video on how to use RC resources for research in the Humanities.

[Applications are due April 1, 2025](https://www.iath.virginia.edu/images/news/DHC-DACfellowship_RFP_final.pdf). We highly recommend all interested applicants (either individually or as a team) email lb-dac-dhc-fellowship at virginia.edu with any questions and/or set up an appointment to discuss ideas, budget possibilities, and proposed collaborations.
