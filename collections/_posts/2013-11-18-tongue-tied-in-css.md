Learning programming languages is both exciting, fascinating, _and_ a bit overwhelming for me. While I find that I'm typically pretty good at learning new languages I'm having difficulty getting energized about learning the back end of building what we see on the web. Ironically, one of the main reasons I applied for Praxis was to learn how to program but the more I become familiar with it, the less I want to do it! Don't get me wrong, I see the value and importance in the skill, I think I'm just way behind on the learning curve and the mountain in front of me seems daunting. Moreover, I don't think I'm ever going to get to  "computer guru" status so I wonder if having a mediocre set of skills will be particularly useful on the job market.

That being said, I'm happy that our group has decided to work within WordPress and develop a game PlugIn instead of building an Ivanhoe from scratch. Not only are there cost benefits to this model, it seems like knowing how to use WordPress in a more meaningful way will be an important skill for me to have and something I will be able to take with me after my fellowship is over. Even though I originally thought I would be building something from the ground up I'm coming to realize that a year would never be enough time for me to do this well. I also have a newfound appreciation for the IT professionals at offices everywhere.
