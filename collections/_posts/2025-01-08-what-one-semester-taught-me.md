...judging from my notes:

* “A blog post can be anything you want it to be”
* What would you like the Scholar’s Lab staff? SNACKS
* who is the “public”?
* Git is how you engage with the community in code
* Computers are deterministic, and determinism is a cage
* Coding as labour
* International Morse Code: actually, not a binary system but trinary (dots, dashes AND pauses)
* “DH can meld critique, social justice, technology, studies of form and language”
* Consideration for an algorithm: space and time
* US = odd Bonne Maman jars fixation 
* sometimes, when we write code, we have to think about strange cases. Think about “edge cases” (technically allowed, but unexpected)
* in Python, WHITE SPACE MATTERS A LOT
* Workflow: pull, edit, save, add, commit, push
* Attention is not a renewable resource
* Speculative minimalist workshop design can offer both training in digital pedagogy and transformative professional development
* Idea of “beyond buttonology”
* Hack-a-thon: short-term collaboration intervention together, lightweight, interesting
* 1. Entice, 2. Inform, 3. Provoke
* SAVE THE FILE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (for changes to appear) (ctrl+s)
* Praxathon = research interest + format + method
* Is it happy or is it sad?
* Just because it’s low tech, doesn’t mean it’s not technical
* Teaching is more than delivering content. Your classroom may be the only safe space some students have.
* "Too many ghosts:("
* How to credit: potentially create a humans.txt. file 
* Inside HTML, <script/> tells it to treat it as Javascript
* Favourite Yellow Journal headline: “UVA OUT OF NOTABLE ALUMNI, FORCED TO NAME THE NEW DORM “BANJO KAZOOIE”
