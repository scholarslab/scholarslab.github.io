 **1.	Things I have learnt from the Scholars’ Lab folks:** <br>
•	[How to brew the perfect cup of coffee](https://coffee.scholarslab.org/).<br>
•	It is okay to love speculative fiction as a grown adult.<br>
•	Silent presence can be as welcoming as words.<br>
•	Imposter syndrome is here to stay. But that’s okay.<br>

**2. Things I have learnt from my Praxis cohort:** <br>
•	The joy of lazy consensus.<br>
•	Stuffed toys are acceptable gifts for adults.<br>
•	The words ‘Lesbian’ and ‘cannibalism’ can be used in the same breath.<br>
•	My childhood obsession with the Little Mermaid was more damaging than I could have imagined.<br>
•	The corrupting influence of power is lost on Project Manager Emmy.<br>

**3.	Why Praxis works:** <br>
The ‘digital’ in DH may be what attracts grad students, but two months in, it’s the people that make you want to stay. Seeing glimpses of the relationships built over years shows students what it means to truly practice the humanities. To acknowledge one’s own humanity and grapple with its needs, and to learn how to navigate the networks of identities within us at each given moment.

**4.	Things that I may or may not steal on my last day as a Praxis Fellow:** <br>
•	Shane’s book on miniatures that I initially thought was about miniature painting.<br>
•	Brandon’s poster of Kurt Vonnegut’s ‘Shapes of Stories.’ <br>
•	Amanda’s giant baguette.<br>
•	Jeremy’s general air of nonchalance.<br>
•	Ronda’s hair.<br>
