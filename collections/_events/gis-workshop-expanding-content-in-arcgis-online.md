**Expanding Content in ArcGIS Online**

You can also use ArcGIS Online as a platform to build custom location-based apps.  You can create stories and context around online maps for things like storytelling, tours or map comparisons.   Many of these applications have templates that make for easy viewing on mobile devices.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be held on **Tuesdays from 3PM to 4PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.  No registration, just show up!
