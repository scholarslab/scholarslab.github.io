The Scholars’ Lab and UVA Library are pleased to bring to Grounds four leaders of literary digital projects focusing on a diverse range of women writers across history.

These four different digital projects share innovative ways to study networks of biographical records, including little-known early modern or eighteenth-century women writers, or all women writers associated with Britain, or women of many occupations across history, as represented circa 1830-1940. The projects have theorized and reflected on the argument and scholarship that go into ontologies, editorial practice, and database and visualization designs. Research collaborators and users of the projects can follow different paths into the archives of text or the personographies. Data visualization; the Text Encoding Initiative in a publishing and repository context; documenting the circulation of reviews, citations, and texts; tagging trends in gender ideology and typologies within the changing features of women’s biographies; and textual analysis are among the approaches we demonstrate and question in our practice.

_Please join us for a full day of presentations as well as frank discussion of the challenges and rewards of four different approaches. All are welcome._
