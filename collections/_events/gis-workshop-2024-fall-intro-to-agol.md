With ArcGIS Online, you can use and create maps and scenes, access ready-to-use maps, layers and analytics, publish data as web layers, collaborate and share, access maps from any device, make maps with your Microsoft Excel data, customize the ArcGIS Online website, and view status reports. 

Registration is required. All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. They will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM** in Shannon 317 and virtually, and are free and open to the UVA and larger Charlottesville community. Check out the registration page for more info.
