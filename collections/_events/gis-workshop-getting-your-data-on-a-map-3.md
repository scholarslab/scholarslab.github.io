Do you have a list of Lat/Lon coordinates or addresses you would like to see on a map? We will show you how to do just that. Through ArcGIS’s Add XY data tool and Geocoding (address matching), it is easy to take your tabular lists and generate points on a map.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Thursdays from 3PM to 4PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
