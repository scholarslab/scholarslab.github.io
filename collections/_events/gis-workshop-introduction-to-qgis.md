ArcGIS isn’t the only game in town.  The best and most popular open source GIS application is QGIS.  It runs on most platforms and does some things better than ArcGIS.  Come learn more about another tool in the GIS toolbox.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be held on **Tuesdays from 10AM to 11AM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.  No registration, just show up!
