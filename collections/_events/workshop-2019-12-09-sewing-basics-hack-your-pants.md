Are you tired of your phone poking out of your pocket? Did you get a new Phablet and now you have nowhere to stick it? This workshop will show you the basics of sewing and show you how to take an old t-shirt and make your pockets bigger. No experience necessary, but you will need to bring your pants and an old t-shirt (or one can be provided. Warning: you will be cutting your pants pockets, and there is a possibility that the pocket will not be to your liking in the end.

Drop in anytime during the workshop hours to hack your pants!

Note: It usually takes 20 minutes for each pocket.

No registration required.
