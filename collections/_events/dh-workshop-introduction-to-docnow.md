title: 'DH Workshop: Introduction to DocNow'
---

In honor of [Endangered Data Week](http://endangereddataweek.org/), join us for an introduction to [DocNow,](http://www.docnow.io/) a tool and community developed around supporting the ethical collection, use, and preservation of social media content.  Scholars' Lab staff and fellows will be on hand to provide a brief introduction to the tool, a discussion of data collection, and a consideration of the [complex, often fraught, stories](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/november-2016/doing-right-online-archivists-shape-an-ethics-for-the-digital-age) that can be told through social media data. All skill levels are welcome and encouraged to attend. Refreshments will be served!
