Want to do your own aerial photography?  We will discuss techniques, equipment, and issues of capturing your own data.

All sessions are one hour and assume attendees have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials with expert assistance.  All sessions, except where noted, will be taught on Wednesdays from 1PM to 2PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free to attend and are open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
