Do you think 3D modeling has to be expensive and time-consuming? Are you curious about 3D printing but unsure where to start?

This workshop will introduce participants to the exciting world of desktop fabrication. We’ll provide a brief overview of current trends and tools for 3D modeling and printing, followed by a hands-on demonstration of basic printer operation. Other topics will include common printing issues and a quick overview of model creation with photogrammetry. While not necessary, participants can bring a laptop to get better acquainted with the software we’ll introduce.

Instructor: [Shane Lin](http://scholarslab.org/people/shane-lin/)

If you can't make this session but would like to learn more about 3D printing, please visit our the student consultants in our [Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/) or email [scholarslab@virginia.edu](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) to set up an individual appointment.
