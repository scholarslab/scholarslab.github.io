Story Maps are templates that allow authors to give context to their ArcGIS Online maps.  Whether telling a story, giving a tour or comparing historic maps, Esri Story Maps are easy-to-use applications that create polished presentations.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be held on **Tuesdays from 10AM to 11AM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.  No registration, just show up!
