Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining is a manufacturing operation that automatically processes a piece of material using pre-programmed instructions. One example of CNC machining is CNC milling, where a milling tool is used to drill and cut the material in a rotary motion. In this workshop, we'll teach you how to make a your metal keychain, dog tag, or any plastic/metal personal accessory that you would like to customize. No experience is required!

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor. See here for TinkerTank open hours: <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours</a>
