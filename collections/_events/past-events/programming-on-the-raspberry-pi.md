In this workshop we'll learn the basics of using your Raspberry Pi for basic Python programming to control LEDs. You should be familiar with using a Raspberry Pi before joining this workshop. Due to limitations of hardware, this workshop only has four open spots. To reserve a spot, send an email to ammon@virginia.edu.
