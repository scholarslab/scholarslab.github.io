title: Introduction to Neatline
---

Join us for a hands-on introduction to Neatline, a set of plugins for Omeka developed by the Scholars’ Lab. With Neatline, anyone can create beautiful, complex maps and narrative sequences from collections of archives and artifacts, and connect maps and narratives with timelines that are more-than-usually sensitive to ambiguity and nuance. See http://neatline.org/ for more information.

Instructor: Ronda Grizzle
