**_DASH-Amerikan: Keeping Up with the Kardashian Media Ecologies_**

Kim and company have never received the critical adulation that Don Draper elicited. Yet the Kardashians’ sheer popularity demands further inspection by scholars who claim interest in the cultural productions that reflect and shape our current historical moment. The Kardashians remain particularly important for their ability to normalize a matriarchal family structure and transform the traditionally private sphere of the home into their center of business, all while maintaining heteronormative assumptions about the objectification of women. Furthermore, their use of Twitter, Instagram, mobile apps, online blogs, and even tabloid coverage work together to engage fans in an unending advertisement for their show. Whether commenting on news events, promoting awareness of the Armenian genocide, or producing extravagant television specials, the Kardashian family has harnessed the 24/7 media landscape in new and unprecedented ways.

The **2016-2017 Praxis Cohort**, which includes **Jordan Buysse** (English), **Alicia Caticha** (Art & Architectural History), **Alyssa Collins **(English), **Justin Greenlee** (Art & Architectural History), **Sarah McEleney** (Slavic Languages & Literatures), and **Joseph Thompson** (History), examines the Kardashian media empire to reveal the discursive power of celebrities, fans, and their critics. To do so, they created a data set of every tweet written by a member of the Kardashian family, as well as every relevant _US Weekly_ article, by using web scraping, text analysis, and topic modeling techniques. Using these digital humanities methods, they aim to interrogate constructions of race, class, and sexuality in contemporary popular culture and the pervasiveness of social media on our daily lives.
