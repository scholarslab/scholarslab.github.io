title: 'Public Libraries and Academic Libraries: Digital Partners?'
---

The growth and development of technology, computers, software, and the Internet have changed the ways in which libraries function, operate, and are being used by the communities they serve. Public libraries have been playing a bit of catch-up in many ways related to the growth of digital services due to the fact that public libraries are also still serving users whose information needs include more traditional resources. Is there a common ground in mission and scope that public libraries and academic libraries serve together? In what ways are these services complementary and what are the ways in which each of these institutions can learn from and share with one another?
