Are you interested in learning about creative ways to sense and control parts of the physical world around you, through applications of electronics and coding? If so, join the first of two workshops on Wednesday, October 28 in the Scholars’ Lab Makerspace! At this workshop, you will have the opportunity to gain an introduction to the basics of physical computing, components of the Arduino software, and examples of projects that used the software. We will also start getting our hands dirty with the technology, so that you can develop your own ideas, and for those who have more advanced physical computing skills, you will be free to work ahead and more independently.




No previous experience in electronics or coding is necessary for participating in this workshop. The only requirement is that you are curious about hacking the physical world with the technology!


Instructor: Margaret Furr

If you can't make this session but would like to learn more about Arduino boards and shields, please visit the student consultants in our [Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/) or email [scholarslab@virginia.edu](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) to set up an individual appointment.
