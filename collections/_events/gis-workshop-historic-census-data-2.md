Would you like to map the poverty in Philadelphia around the turn of the 20th Century? How about a racial breakdown by state in the 1860s? This workshop will focus on how to download historic census boundary and tabular data to make historic demographic maps.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Thursdays from 3PM to 4PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
