Unleash those creative juices and join us for a laidback workshop amidst exams! Learn how to use a 3D-printed mini
printing press; use stencils or carve your own design and make some art!

Materials will be provided; feel free to bring any recyclable materials (that you don't mind getting ink on to use as design templates! (Think small leaves, thin lego blocks, something that could leave an imprint!)
