Doctoral education opens doors to engaging and often unexpected pathways, with opportunities for significant public impact—an essential element of reinvesting in higher education as a public good.  In this joint talk, Katina Rogers and Cihan Tekay will discuss how building a university that is truly worth fighting for means thinking more expansively about what constitutes scholarly success—not only to support individual career pathways, but also to work toward greater equity and inclusion in the academy. Rogers and Tekay will talk about their individual pathways as well as their work at CUNY, including how the Futures Initiative aims to design new structures for higher education. The talk will draw on Tekay's academic and public work, as well as Rogers' forthcoming book, _[Putting the Humanities PhD to Work: Thriving in and Beyond the Academy](https://www.dukeupress.edu/putting-the-humanities-phd-to-work)_, which explores the evolving rhetoric and practices regarding career preparation and how those changes intersect with admissions practices, scholarly reward structures, and academic labor practices—especially the increasing reliance on contingent labor. 

Katina L. Rogers is Co-Director of the [Futures Initiative](https://futuresinitiative.org/) and Director of Programs and Administration of [HASTAC](https://www.hastac.org/) at The Graduate Center, City University of New York. She is joined in presenting by Cihan Tekay, a doctoral candidate in anthropology who is writing her dissertation on how people’s engagement with technology, economy and politics shape possible futures. Tekay is also a graduate fellow at the Futures Initiative.
