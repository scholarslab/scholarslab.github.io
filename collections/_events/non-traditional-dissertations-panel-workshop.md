title: 'Diss-entangling from the Monograph: A Non-traditional Dissertations Panel'
---

As part of Grad Days 2018, join us for a conversation about dis-entangling from the monograph dissertation. Our panelists will share their own experiences in departing from the traditional printed format — through hip-hop, comics, code and other forms of doctoral research — and will answer your questions during our Q + A!

Coffee and snacks will be provided.

**A.D. Carson** is a performance artist and professor in Hip-Hop and the Global South at UVa. His award-winning 2017 dissertation from Clemson University, “Owning My Masters: The Rhetorics of Rhymes & Revolutions,” is a digital archive that features a 34-track rap album.

**Nick Sousanis** is a professor in Humanities & Liberal Studies at San Francisco State University, where he is starting an interdisciplinary Comics Studies program. His doctoral dissertation, Unflattening, written and drawn entirely in comic form, was published by Harvard University Press in 2015.

**Amanda Visconti** is the Managing Director of the Scholars’ Lab at UVa. Her 2015 dissertation from the University of Maryland fully acknowledges digital methods as scholarship by treating them as the dissertation instead of addenda to traditional written chapters. Her participatory digital edition of James Joyce’s Ulysses, InfiniteUlysses.com, was cited in the New York Times.
