Curious about wearable computing but afraid to ask? Have ideas about how to make your life simpler with hacks for your outerwear or accessories?

This beginner workshop will introduce the basics of circuity and give an overview of current trends in wearable computing. Participants will make their own circuit using LED's and conductive thread. Materials will be provided and no experience with sewing or electronics is necessary.

[Note: This workshop was originally scheduled for Feb. 25, and had to be moved to accommodate a conflicting event.]
