Are you curious about 3D printing but unsure where to start? Have you had a bit of experience with modeling, but you want to continue to explore?

This workshop will introduce participants to the exciting world of desktop fabrication. We’ll provide a brief overview of current trends and tools for 
3D modeling and printing, followed by a hands-on demonstration of basic printer operation. We will also discuss various types of 3D models and 
the best practices and equipment for bringing them to life. While not necessary, participants can bring a laptop to get better acquainted with the 
software we’ll introduce.
