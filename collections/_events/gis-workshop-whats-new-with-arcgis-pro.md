title: 'GIS Workshop: What’s New with ArcGIS Pro'
---

The handwriting is on the wall.  ArcGIS Pro will be replacing ArcMap as the desktop GIS in the near future.  Come learn about the changes and quirks of ArcGIS Pro from an ArcMap user prospective.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be held on **Tuesdays from 10AM to 11AM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.  No registration, just show up!
