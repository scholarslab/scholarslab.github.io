Using [Neatline](http://neatline.org/), anyone can create beautiful, interactive maps, timelines, and narrative sequences from collections of archives and artifacts, telling scholarly stories in a whole new way. Join us for this hands-on introduction to Neatline. See [http://neatline.org/](http://neatline.org/) for more information.

Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials, and assume no previous experience. All sessions will be taught in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free to attend and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
