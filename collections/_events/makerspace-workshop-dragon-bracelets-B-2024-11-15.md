Come make your own pet dragon with the Cosplay Costuming & Crafts Club! All supplies and materials will be provided. The workshop lasts 3 hours, you are encouraged to arrive on time so you have the full workshop to work on your project, but feel free to leave early if you finish your project before the end of the event. In this WorkShop, you will make a smol dwagon friend that will fit right around your wrist and hand like a glove.

Due to a waitlist, if you have to cancel your RSVP, please do so at least 24 hours in advance to the time the event occurs. For inquiries, contact virginiacostuming@gmail.com

Do not sign up for session B if you've already registered for session A. This is 1-session Workshop and projects should be completed in the span of 1 day. Both sessions are identical so please avoid duplicate RSVPs.
