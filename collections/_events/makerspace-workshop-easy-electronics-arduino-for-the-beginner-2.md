---

Come learn the basics of using the Arduino for fun or profit. No experience or equipment needed. Arduino kits and laptops provided to use in class, but you are welcome to bring your own. This workshop will go through the very basics of electricity, how to setup the Arduino, and building a first circuit; an LED nightlight.
