Did you miss October 28 workshop on working with Arduino, or were you hoping to experiment more with the technology? Join the second of two workshops on Wednesday, November 4 in the Scholars’ Lab Makerspace to gain an introduction to the basics of physical computing, components of the Arduino software, and examples of projects that used the software. Like in the first workshop, we will also begin getting our hands dirty with the technology, and those who have more advanced physical computing skills are free to work ahead, more independently on prototyping projects. 




Again, no previous experience in electronics or coding is necessary for participating in this workshop!


Instructor: Margaret Furr

If you can't make this session but would like to learn more about Arduino boards and shields, please visit the student consultants in our [Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/) or email [scholarslab@virginia.edu](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) to set up an individual appointment.
