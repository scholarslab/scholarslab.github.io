**Making Things That Make Things: The Surprisingly Friendly World of Generative Programs**

Join Kate Compton in the Scholars’ Lab for a creative coding workshop on generative programs! Learn how to use **Tracery** – a **super-simple tool** and language for generating text, used for making **twitterbots**, artbots, games, and stories – and how Tracery fits into the world of generativity as a whole. We’ll also be learning about **Generominos**, generative ideation cards that help you design your interactive artwork, alt-control game, or generative art experiment. **Bring your laptop! Everyone is welcome, no coding experience necessary!**
