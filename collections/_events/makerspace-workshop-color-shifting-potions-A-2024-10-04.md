Come make your own color shifting potions with the Cosplay Costuming & Crafts Club! All supplies and materials will be provided (though you are encouraged to bring your own bottles and jars if you have a really cool potion vessel you want to use). The workshop lasts 3 hours, you are encouraged to arrive on time so you have the full workshop to work on your project, but feel free to leave early if you finish your project before the end of the event time. In this WorkShop, you will make a dual-color changing potion using different dyes and mica powder, as well as embellish your productions with foam clay, twine, wax/glue and other deocrative designs.

Due to a waitlist, if you have to cancel your RSVP, please do so at least 24 hours in advance to the time the event occurs. For inquiries, contact virginiacostuming@gmail.com
