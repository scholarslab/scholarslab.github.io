**Call for Praxis Fellowship Applications**
The [Praxis Program](http://scholarslab.org/praxis-program-fellowships/) is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars’ Lab. Its fellowships support a team of six University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. **Applications are due February 15th, 2018 for the 2018-2019 cohort.**



**Call for DH Prototyping Fellowship Applications**
The [Digital Humanities Prototyping Fellowship](http://scholarslab.org/digital-humanities-prototyping-fellowships/) allows UVa graduate students to work with our R&D team for a single semester to rapidly develop their digital project ideas and position themselves for future work in digital humanities. The Scholars’ Lab offers these fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. This program offers support to projects that might not fit the normal scope of the other fellowship programs: proposed projects may be collaborative, offer unusual outcomes, or represent significant departures from previous research. The fellowship is meant to help students rapidly acquire skills, to wireframe or prototype a project, and perhaps implement the first stages of a plan for further study. **Applications are due February 15th, 2018 for the 2018-2019 cohort.**
