title: 'Workshop: Planning & Designing Your Neatline Project'
---

You've been doing research that spans both space and time, and you want to create an exhibit that explains your work visually, as well as textually. What's a tool that can help you do that? How about Neatline?

This workshop will guide you through the process of evaluating your data and figuring out how to illustrate your scholarly argument using map annotations and timelines. No previous experience with Neatline or other mapping tools is assumed or required. Open to everyone.

Instructor: Ronda Grizzle
