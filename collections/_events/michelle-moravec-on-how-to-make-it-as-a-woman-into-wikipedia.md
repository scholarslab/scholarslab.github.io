title: Michelle Moravec on How to Make it as a Woman in(to) Wikipedia
---

[Michelle Moravec](https://michellemoravec.com/) is an associate professor of history at Rosemont College in Philadelphia, where she also teaches women’s and gender studies. Her method of [Writing In Public](http://michellemoravec.com/michelle-moravec/) is indebted to the practices of the feminist activists she studies.  She has published extensively about feminist art and social movements in the United States.  Her current project, [_The Politics of Women’s Culture_](http://historyinthecity.wordpress.com/), uses a combination of digital and traditional approaches to produce an intellectual history of the concept of women’s culture.
