Bring a Buddy to make a Buddy!


Come to the Tinker tank to make a stuffed buddy! Learn how to create, cut, and sew a stuffed animal pattern. We provide some premade example patterns or you can bring your simple pattern to use. If you have a fabric you would like to recycle, feel free to bring it! Blankets are reccomended.

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor. See here for TinkerTank open hours: <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours</a>
