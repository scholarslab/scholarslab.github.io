title: 'Human Centered Design Workshop: Paper Prototyping'
---









This workshop series is for everyone who wants to "create something that is useful and will make people happy.” You will develop your own small project over four weeks, culminating in a prototype that makes you proud.  The sessions will build on each other, and you can count on a few out-of-class hours of work per week, but we promise to have a lot of fun!










**In session 2, you will learn how to rapidly design your idea using only pen and paper, and how to determine if your design is effective.**























Marcus Kossatz studies Computer Science and Media at Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Germany. He is a visiting scholar in the Scholars' Lab, working on [Histoglobe](http://www.histoglobe.com/#), his Master's Thesis in Digital Humanities. Driven by the desire to create something useful and fueled by a passion for usability and human-machine interaction, he will share his experiences with you.














If you have questions, visit the Scholars' Lab or email Marcus Kossatz at [marcus.kossatz@uni-weimar.de](mailto:marcus.kossatz@uni-weimar.de).
