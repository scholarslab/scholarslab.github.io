![Hollow Book Safe](/assets/post-media/workshops/book-safe.png)

Bring an old book to hollow out and make a safe place to store your valuables!

A limited number of books will be available. All other tools provided. No experience needed.

It only takes an hour to make the safe, so you won't need to stay for the whole workshop time.
