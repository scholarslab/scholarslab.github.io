In this interactive workshop, participants will learn the basics of photogrammetry by making their own 3D model out of regular 2D photographs. We will discuss practical applications of photogrammetry, as well as the different strategies and tools available to accomplish personal research goals. While not necessary, participants can bring a digital camera or smartphone and laptop to get better acquainted with the photogrammetry process and software.
