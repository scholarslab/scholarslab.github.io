title: 'GIS Workshop: Georeferencing a Map – Putting Old Maps and Aerial Photos on
  Your Map'
---

Would you like to see historic map overlaid on modern aerial photography?  Do you need to extract features of a map for use in GIS?  Georeferencing is the first step.  We will show you how to take a scan of a paper map and align in it in ArcGIS.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.  No registration, just show up!

For the full schedule of the [Fall 2018 UVa Library GIS Workshop Series](http://scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/fall-2018-uva-library-gis-workshop-series/), see [here](http://scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/fall-2018-uva-library-gis-workshop-series/).
