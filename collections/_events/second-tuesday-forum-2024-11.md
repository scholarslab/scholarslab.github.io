UVA English Assistant Professor Dana Little examines social media's underlying algorithmic architecture and it's impact on social discourse. We will review the role of artificial intelligence in "AI-guided" online narratives focusing specifically on the concept of "factions."

Factions, in the context of AI-guided content creation and curation, is a social media genre that uses search engine optimization, AI algorithms, templates, and human-computer collaboration to create narratives that blend fact and fiction, fostering online personas and communities that both reflect and challenge reality.

By examining the rhetoric and aesthetics employed by AI models to create and characterize these narrative factions, I aim to offer insights into the underlying mechanisms that shape AI-generated online discourse.

Key Topics:

* Defining Factions: A clear explanation of factions as a social media genre, emphasizing the use of SEO, AI algorithms, templates, and human-computer collaboration to create blended narratives.
* Rhetorical Strategies: An exploration of the persuasive techniques used by AI models to convey factions tropes within the blended narratives, particularly propaganda, appeals to emotion, and logical arguments.
* Aesthetic Choices: A discussion of how AI models employ visual and auditory elements to represent different factions features, including memetic structures, tonal modulation sound design, and narrative pacing.
* Case Studies: In-depth analysis of specific AI-guided factions to illustrate the concepts of blended narratives, rhetoric, and aesthetics.
* Implications and Future Directions: A consideration of the potential implications of AI-guided factions, including their impact on audience engagement, ethical considerations, and the future of storytelling.

This presentation offers an exploration of the intersection between artificial intelligence, rhetoric, and aesthetics. By understanding the intricacies of AI-guided factions, we can gain valuable insights into the future of information dissemination, storytelling, and the role of technology in shaping our cultural narratives.
