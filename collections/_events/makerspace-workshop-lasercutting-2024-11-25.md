Learn the basics of laser cutting and explore the different applications that it has in various industries! We'll begin by creating a design in Adobe Illustrator and then using the Universal Laser Systems laser cutter to engrave, cut, or raster the material. You will gain hands-on experience with setting up the laser cutter, selecting the appropriate materials, and adjusting the settings for different tasks. By the end of the workshop, you will have a personalized creation!
