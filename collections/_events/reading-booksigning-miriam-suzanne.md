Join us at [OpenGrounds](http://opengrounds.virginia.edu/) on the Corner as Miriam reads from her mixed-media, open-source novel, Riding SideSaddle*.  This event is free and open to the public.

**[Riding SideSaddle](http://www.ridingsidesaddle.com/)*** is a fragmented memory written on 250 interchangeable index cards — following a cast of friends as they navigate fluid genders, relationships, and bodies that resist order, category, or completion. Based loosely on the life of Margaret Clap, and the myth of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus — SideSaddle* is an [ open-source text ](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) published by [SpringGun Press](http://springgunpress.com), [released online](http://oddbooksapp.com/book/ridingsidesaddle) by [OddBird](http://oddbird.net/), and adapted to the stage by [Buntport Theater](http://buntport.com/archive/archive.htm) and [Teacup Gorilla](http://teacupgorilla.com).
