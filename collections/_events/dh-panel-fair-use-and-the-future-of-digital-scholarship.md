_Can fair use extend beyond the selection?  What if your research could include copyrighted works? What questions could you ask of a corpus of millions of digitized texts or other data? _

Explore the rich tradition of digital research at UVA, and learn how recent fair use decisions in the courts are opening up new vistas for textual scholarship. Panelists will include: Andrew Stauffer, UVA Associate Professor of English and Director of [NINES](http://www.nines.org/) and the [Book Traces](http://www.booktraces.org/) project; Jonathan Band, an expert on the Google Books litigation; and Stephen Downie, Co-Director of the [HathiTrust Research Center](https://sharc.hathitrust.org/), which facilitates digital research on a massive corpus of mostly in-copyright books. Moderated by Brandon Butler, the Library's new Director of Information Policy.

![Stephen.Downie](http://scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stephen.Downie-110x110.png)J. Stephen Downie is the Associate Dean for Research and a Professor at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is the Illinois Co-Director of the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC). He was the Principal Investigator on the Networked Environment for Music Analysis (NEMA) project, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. He was Co-PI on the Structural Analysis of Large Amounts of Music Information (SALAMI) project, jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the UK’s Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). Dr. Downie is the leader of the Hathitrust + Bookworm (HT+BW) text analysis project that is creating tools to visualize the evolution of term usage over time.  All of these aforementioned projects share a common thread of striving to provide large-scale analytic access to copyright-restricted cultural data.
