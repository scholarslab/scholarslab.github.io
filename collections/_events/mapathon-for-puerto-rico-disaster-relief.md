Join the the Scholars' Lab and the UVA Library to assist relief efforts in Puerto Rico. Many aid groups are reporting difficulty providing support to those in need because digital maps of the island are incomplete. Help us improve those maps using [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84). You will need a laptop, but no experience is required. Feel free to stop in anytime between 1:00 and 5:00, and stay for as long as you are able. We will have coffee and cookies for those participating.
