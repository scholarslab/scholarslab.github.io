Until we perfect that magic “extract all those lines from this paper map” button we’re stuck using editing tools to get that job done.  If you’re lucky, someone else has done the work to create your points, lines, and polygons but maybe they need your magic touch to make them better.  This session shows you how to create and modify vector features in ArcGIS Pro, the world’s most popular geographic information systems software.  We’ll explore tools to create new points, lines, and polygons and to edit existing datasets.  At version 10, ArcMap’s editor was revamped introducing new templates, but we’ll keep calm and carry on.  

Registration is required. All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. They will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 2PM to 3PM** in Shannon 317 and virtually, and are free and open to the UVA and larger Charlottesville community. Check out the registration page for more info.
