Intro to Mini-Making and D&D Basics: Have you ever been curious about the
tabletop gaming hobby? Heard of Dungeons and Dragons, but not sure how it
works? Want to paint a tiny figurine that you can show off to your friends? In
this workshop, we'll be discussing the basics of tabletop gaming as a form of
group storytelling, learning how to build characters, and painting mini-figures
for use in play.

All materials are provided and no prior experience needed.

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor.
