title: 'Daniel Shore on Cultural Constructicography: DH Discussion and Workshop'
---

**Please join us for "Cultural Constructicography," a discussion and workshop with Daniel Shore.**

Come learn how digital archives and advanced search tools can help us revise our understanding of the history of language, the nature of the sign, and the "structure" of Structuralism. The session will begin with a short talk about the arguments of the recent book, [_Cyberformalism: Histories of Linguistic Forms in the Digital Archive_](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/cyberformalism), move to a demonstration of corpus-based research methods, and end with a workshop format where students can try out corpus methods on their own research topics and get coaching.

[**Daniel Shore**](https://georgetown.academia.edu/DanielShore), Provost's Distinguished Associate Professor of English at Georgetown University, is the author of _Cyberformalism: Histories of Linguistic Forms in the Digital Archive_ (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2018) and _Milton and the Art of Rhetoric_ (Cambridge University Press, 2012), and of articles in journals including PMLA, Critical Inquiry, Modern Philology, Shakespeare Quarterly, Milton Studies and others. His research has been supported by the American Council of Learned Societies, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the Folger Shakespeare Library, and he is the co-founder of the Six Degrees of Francis Bacon project.

RSVP is requested, but not mandatory. Please email Julie Gronlund (gronlund@virginia.edu) with your RSVP and any questions.

This event is hosted by the [Humanities Informatics Lab](http://humanities-informatics.as.virginia.edu/upcoming-events), at the Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures.
