Poetry is a form of transformation. Typically, it is a metamorphosis that turns to ink as its final gesture. What if we explore that endpoint? In this workshop, I’ll demonstrate how to use an Arduino to recognize a poem, of no more than 14 lines (roughly, just for time’s sake) from each participant, to create another expression of the artwork with visual LED lights and musical tones. The code will use Kandinsky’s theory of art and collage as a basis for its transformations. Come ready to see/hear some great poems!
