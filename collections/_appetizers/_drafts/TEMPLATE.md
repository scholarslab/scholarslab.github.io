<!-- 
1. [](): Descriptive sentence per item, if any, can be formatted like this.

"intro" line in YAML can be entirely deleted if no intro exists (though pls do write one)

"order: " line in YAML will later be used to display all the apps in the order we want on the page, but does nothing right now so ignore and leave there but empty (as is)
