*String Data Art: the Social Network Analysis of Concurso de Cante Jondo (1922)* is a data art installation created by our 2025-2026 Data Artist [Sara Arribas Colmenar](/people/sara-arribas-colmenar).

As part of her completed Penn State dissertation, *Constellations of Artists: A Study of Creative Spaces and Social Network Analysis in Spanish Intellectual Public Exhibitions and Circuits (1909-1936)*, Dr. Arribas Colmenar used data visualization methods to map cultural networks within Spain’s artistic and intellectual circles. This project aims to translate the results of a social network analysis (SNA) of the Concurso de Cante Jondo (1922) into a physical string art piece. The Concurso de Cante Jondo (1922) was a pivotal cultural event in the history of flamenco, held in Granada to preserve and promote the purest form of flamenco singing. The data for this project was carefully curated from various historical sources, including official records, newspapers, and photographs, allowing for the mapping of key events, people, and connections that defined the contest and its impact on the flamenco and cultural scene of the time.

Dr. Arribas Colmenar has actively documented her design, research, and building process on social media: [@sararribas.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/sararribas.bsky.social), including through using the [#DHmakes hashtag](https://bsky.app/search?q=from%3Asararribas.bsky.social+%23dhmakes) during Spring and Summer 2025.

Her 2025 peer-reviewed journal article, ["Constelaciones de artistas: análisis y teoría de redes aplicado a la danza y el teatro español (1914-1934)"](https://doi.org/10.5944/rhd.vol.10.2025.42787) discusses the methodological digital humanities scholarship that also drives her critical making work: social network analysis (SNA) applied to historical dance and theater.
