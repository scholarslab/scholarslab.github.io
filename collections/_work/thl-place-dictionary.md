The "Places Portal" of the [Tibetan and Himalayan Library](http://thlib.org) stems from a long collaboration between the Scholars' Lab and THL staff. "Places," which includes a complex gazetteer, is the area of THL where spatial and geographical data is archived and presented, as well as where rich studies of specific places are published.
