<p>Alison Booth’s <a href="http://womensbios.lib.virginia.edu/about">Collective Biographies of Women</a> began as a simple electronic text which, in collaboration with the Scholars’ Lab, blossomed into a rich instrument for the study of prosopography. Professor Booth has been selected as an <a href="http://iath.virginia.edu/">IATH</a> and <a href="http://www.acls.org/research/digital.aspx?id=798">ACLS Fellow</a> on the merit of this work.</p>
