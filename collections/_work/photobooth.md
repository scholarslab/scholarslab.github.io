A free, public "photobooth" created by Ammon Shepherd as a group learning projects with student Makerspace Technicians, while SLab's Makerspace was in a small, temporary "TinkerTank" space during Shannon Library's renovation. The photobooth uses Python code and a Raspeberry Pi. 

Visitors press a button to snap 3 photos in quick succession, and two copies of a photobooth-style strip of the 3 photos print out for you to take. A frequent beloved exhibit at the "Lighting of the Lawn", and available just outside our Makerspace in the Scholars' Lab Text Aisle year-round any time Shannon Library is open.

In Spring 2026, Ammon presented on [the Python code](https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/event/16232027) he wrote to run the photobooth; the code is shared publicly on GitHub: [github.com/ammonshepherd/simplebooth](https://github.com/ammonshepherd/simplebooth).
