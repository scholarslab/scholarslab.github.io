Like the previous cohort, this year's group took the concept of time as their provocation, but they took it in a wildly different direction. Reflecting broadly on how the Kardashian family pervades our present moment, Dash-Amerikan uses variety of digital humanities methodologies to interrogate their social media ecologies. Assembling and topic modeling a vast archive of twitter data and episode transcripts, the cohort produced a lengthy digital essay that sits at the intersections of media studies, digital humanities, and public humanities.
