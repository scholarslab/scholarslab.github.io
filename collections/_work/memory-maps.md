*Memory Maps* is a collaborative, ongoing installation that interrogates what it means to be human in a world that is increasingly shifting toward the machine.  A response to the explosion in popularity of large language models, particularly in how they consume and flatten work from artists and writers without proper attribution, *Memory Maps* imagines what an ethical, community-based technological system might look like, independent of artificial intelligence. The system invites the visitor to the installation to participate as a creator, both crediting them, and choreographing a continual conversation between the past and the future.

Zhou and Shepherd presented their in-progress work on *Memory Maps* at the Fall 2024 international ISAM Conference ([conference poster here](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/assets/post-media/isam2024/holly-isam2024-student-poster.pdf)).

The installation is currently on display in the Scholars' Lab (Shannon Library 308), and will eventually travel to other locations as well.

<!-- Explanation of what the exhibits looks like and does could go here? -->

## Exhibit 3D model

Ask Arin, or use app to make/upload e.g. Scaniverseâ€”below is what the embed code looked like when we did this with the data quilt:
<iframe width="700px" height="700px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://scaniverse.com/scan/z6aldwod33udye3j?embed=1"></iframe>

NAME captured this 3D scan of the front of the exhibit; use your cursor to move it around a bit, to get a sense of the depth and texture of the quilt, and the command key will let you pan around the 3D object instead of just pivoting it (helpful when zooming in on details).
