*Footpath for the People?* is a data quilt designed and created by Scholars' Lab's inaugural Virtual Artist-in-Residence [Claudia Berger](/people/claudia-berger) during the 2024-2025 academic year, with an accompanying [zine](https://zinebakery.com/redistro/FFTPzine) explaining how to read the quilt's data physicalization, and the research, goals, and methods used to realize the project. Berger also blogged the design process leading to the quilt at ["Designing a Data Physicalization: A love letter to dot grid paper"](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/berger-designing-data-viz/) on our research blog.

The quilt is currently on display in the Scholars' Lab Common Room (Shannon Library 308), opposite our main entrance. Copies of the zine are on a table below the quilt, or can be [read or printed from online](https://zinebakery.com/redistro/FFTPzine) for free.
