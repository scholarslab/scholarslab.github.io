The SLab GIS Sandbox is a (currently work-in-progress) mixed real+virtual reality system offering an actual sandbox where teachers and researchers can shape topographic surfaces, which are then color-mapped and augmented with topographic contour lines and simulated water using a 3D camera and projector.

The first version of our GIS Sandbox started many years back, but in Summer 2025 Drew MacQueen and Chris Gist rejuvenated it, and are continuing this work-in-progress to add new features. The Sandbox builds on [Oliver Kreylos'](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/) generously open-sourced research and code.

The sandbox is not currently available for public use; stay tuned for an announcement when that becomes available.

## SLab GIS Sandbox 2.0
