*[#ByteSized Pedagogy](https://walshbr.com/byte-sized-pedagogy)* is a free and open-to-the-public zoom series on digital pedagogy features paired lightning talks introducing teaching topics, interesting approaches to the classroom, pedagogical concepts, and more. All in a bite-sized form that should still give you plenty to chew on. In the spirit of [Amanda Wyatt Visconti's](/people/amanda-visconti) [#DHMakes Methodz talks](https://amandavisconti.github.io/DHMakesMethodz/), each session will be built around paired 5 minute presentations followed by facilitated discussion for the remainder of the time. We will be gathering social media commentary using [the #ByteSizedPedagogy hashtag](https://bsky.app/search?q=%23ByteSizedPedagogy).

The presentations can cover a wide variety of topics: a tool that is new to you, a teaching tip, pedagogical concept, assignment, your syllabus for a DH course, etc. We’re interested in showcasing anything you have found that moves you or your students in the classroom, that has worked well or failed utterly. And we are very interested in perspectives from folks in all different kinds of positions and institutional contexts - higher ed, K-12, administrators, cultural heritage workers, and more. After the session, each speaker will submit a short one-page (max) version of their five-minute presentation that we’ll collect into a crowdsourced, citable web publication of bite-sized DH pedagogical goodness.

See the *[#ByteSized Pedagogy site](https://walshbr.com/byte-sized-pedagogy)* for all past and upcoming talks, as well as links to the work published on each talk. You can also see any upcoming #ByteSized Pedagogy talks being hosted by Scholars' Lab listed on our [upcoming events page](/events).
