Our work on [Omeka](http://omeka.org) is oriented toward adapting it for use in research and special collections libraries and with scholarly digital projects that build on library- or museum-managed archival resources. Our major Omeka project is [Neatline](../neatline), but we've also done recent work on [UVA Special Collections exhibits](http://explore.lib.virginia.edu) and [a project](http://falmouth.lib.virginia.edu/) in collaboration with architectural historian [Louis Nelson](http://www.arch.virginia.edu/faculty/LouisNelson/).

We've developed the following plugins for the Omeka platform



    
  * [Bagit](https://github.com/scholarslab/BagItPlugin): Implements the BagIt specification for storing and transporting collections of files.

    
  * [FedoraConnector](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/FedoraConnector): FedoraConnector will make it possible to use objects from a [Fedora Commons](http://www.fedora-commons.org) repository inside Omeka. This will permit users to comment on, annotate, and curate objects in the Fedora repository while using the simple, easy-to-learn Omeka interface.

    
  * [Neatline](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/neatline/):  allows scholars, students, and curators to tell stories with maps and timelines. As a suite of add-on tools for Omeka, it opens new possibilities for hand-crafted, interactive spatial and temporal interpretation.

    
  * [NeatlineFeatures](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/neatlinefeatures/): NeatlineFeatures will allow users to visually manipulate geographic features with simple editors and combine features with material from NeatlineMaps to create even more powerful interactive maps.

    
  * [NeatlineMaps](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/neatlinemaps/): NeatlineMaps connects the powerful open-source geospatial server [GeoServer](http://www.geoserver.org) and Omeka. It permits users to ingest georeferenced images into Omeka and use them as parts of interactive maps.

    
  * [NeatlineTime](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/neatlinetime/): Allows users to create customized timelines of Omeka items and events, and provides the ability to browse an Omeka archive on a timeline.

    
  * [SolrSearch](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/solrsearch/): Use the Solr search engine with Omeka.



We've developed the following themes for the Omeka platform

       
  * [Astrolabe](http://omeka.org/add-ons/themes/astrolabe/): a theme based on the design for [neatline.org](http://neatline.org/).

       
  * [Neatscape](http://omeka.org/add-ons/themes/neatscape/): a modern responsive theme design with support for Neatline views.



We've also worked on some experimental plugins:

    
  * [EADImporter](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/EadImporter): EADImporter opens archival connections by allowing users to absorb Encoded Archival Description XML documents (the standard way for archives to describe their contents) into an Omeka repository.

    
  * [GenericXmlImporter](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/GenericXmlImporter): Import any arbitrary, flat XML data in to Omeka

    
  * [NeatlineWebService](https://github.com/scholarslab/NeatlineWebService): Provides a public-facing facade for the Neatline plugin that makes it possible for public users to create accounts and use Neatline as a hosted web application.

    
  * [TeiDisplay](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/TeiDisplay): Render TEI files in HTML form that are attached to Omeka items.

    
  * [VRACoreElementSet](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/VraCoreElementSet): Bring the VRA Core Element Set in to Omeka
