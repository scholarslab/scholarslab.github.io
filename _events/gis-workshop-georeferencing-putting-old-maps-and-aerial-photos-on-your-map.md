title: 'GIS Workshop: Georeferencing – Putting Old Maps and Aerial Photos on Your
  Map'
---

Have an old map or an aerial photograph that you would like to use as a spatial layer? This session will teach you techniques to properly place your data and make it useable in GIS software. We will also demo similar techniques for Google Earth.

All sessions are one hour and assume attendees have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials with expert assistance. All sessions will be taught in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free to attend and are open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
