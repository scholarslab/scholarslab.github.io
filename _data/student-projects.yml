  description: "Julia's dissertation research investigates the ruins of a 19th century sugar estate, the material culture excavated from the laborers’ village on the plantation, and colonial archival records inside Bras d’Eau National park, Mauritius. During her DH fellowship, she focused on reworking the data she had collected, including maps of archaeological ruins, sketches from excavations and of artifacts collected, and extensive artifact catalogues. Recreating the material world through digital mediums such as ArcGIS, Adobe Illustrator and 3D printing allowed her to better understand how the daily activities of indentured women, men, and children shaped the cultural and environmental landscape in colonial Mauritius and fit more broadly in Indian Ocean World networks."

  description: "In support of his dissertation on the interconnected development of civilian encryption technology and digital privacy rights, Shane's fellowship project analyzes Usenet conversations about cryptography and privacy between 1981 and 2000. Usenet was an early digital communications network, a key precursor to Web discussion forums and later online communities and social networks. In its heyday, it offered a genuinely vast sampling of public, potentially pseudonymous discussion organized neatly into hierarchies of \"newsgroups\" as diverse as alt.sex, rec.drugs, and alt.rock-n-roll. Over the course of his Digital Humanities Fellowship, Shane has written a set of software tools to scrape and process the raw data from select newsgroups, discover adjacent groups and key figures of influence, and map the flow of ideas and networks of interaction across domains and time."

  description: This mapping and data visualization project traces the role of publishers and printers in Jorge Luis Borges’s Argentina (1930-1951) and provides a digital archive of records of the physical features of books from this moment and time in history. This project has two distinct elements. The first is an interactive map of the locations of Borges's publisher, printers, booksellers, and places of employment from 1930 to 1951. The second part of the project is a descriptive bibliography, or a description of the physical elements of the books that Borges wrote, prologued, translated, or edited during the 1930s and 1940s.

  description: The Age of Lead examines the relationship between metropolitan development and lead poisoning in Baltimore from the late-nineteenth century to the late-twentieth century. In particular, I trace how concerns about environmental health in the city fostered the desire for suburban living, but how suburbanization deepened and even caused disparities in lead hazards between the suburbs and the inner city. His dissertation won the 2017 Council of Graduate Schools/ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Award in the Humanities and Fine Arts, and we helped him process and visualize his map data.

  description: Songs of the Victorians is an archive of parlor and art song settings of Victorian poems, and also a scholarly tool to facilitate interdisciplinary music and poetry scholarship. Augmented Notes is a website where users upload scores, audio files, and measure information to produce websites like Songs of the Victorians, thus enabling scholars to pursue their own interdisciplinary projects.

  description: "Community Listening in Isle Royale National Park traces how I became part of a dialogue among a team of wolf biologists and a community of park-explorers who share a unique deep listening relationship. The scientists involved in this project are the primary investigators in the five-decade long wolf/moose project, the longest continuous wildlife study in the world. The primary way these researchers determine clues of wolf reproduction is to listen for the sounds of group howling during the summer months when excitement at den sites erupts during pup feeding time. The ethnographic composition weaves together several different types of sound data collected during fieldwork: soundscape recordings of the place, interviews with the wolf/moose researchers, interviews with park visitors and employees, audio diaries, an audio essay derived from field notes, and archival recordings."

Imagined as the digital instantiation of a vaporware game that was played in the Scholars' Lab and SpecLab, the site allows users to upload documents for a group to interpret along various interpretive axes. The tool has seen significant use in K-12 classrooms."

Built as a WordPress theme, the tool asks users to contibute a text, adopt different roles, and then collectively reinvent that document by writing alternative narratives. Think of it as collaborative fan fiction meets exegesis - by playing out the roles of characters in new ways, Ivanhoe asks users to make interventions."

The site offers several different sonifications of its own, serves as a platform for teaching sonification to others, and focuses on the programming language SuperCollider."

Reflecting broadly on how the Kardashian family pervades our present moment, Dash-Amerikan uses variety of digital humanities methodologies to interrogate their social media ecologies. Assembling and topic modeling a vast archive of twitter data and episode transcripts, the cohort produced a lengthy digital essay that sits at the intersections of media studies, digital humanities, and public humanities."

More specifically, Augmenting the University integrates documents from UVA’s special collections library with physical spaces around grounds. Ultimately, we hope to use AR to allow users to experience these limited-access spaces and objects in new ways that prompt critical reflection on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university."
