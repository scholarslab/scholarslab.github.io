Matt Ford is a senior anthropology major at Vassar College in New York. Following a yearlong domestic exchange at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Matt's summer research in the University of Virginia's Leadership Alliance Mellon Initiative program examines the evolution of non-binary gender performance in Black fashion and popular music through Grace Jones, Prince, and self-portraiture. Matt is further interested in ethnomusicology, Black queer liberation theology, and free knowledge-sharing digital platforms.
