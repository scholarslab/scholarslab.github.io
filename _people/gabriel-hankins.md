Gabriel Hankins is a PhD candidate in English Language and Literature, specializing in transnational modernism and new approaches to modeling distributed textual networks. Gabriel's dissertation project investigates the idea of world government in fiction from 1919-1945, from Wells's "Modern Utopia" and Huxley's "Brave New World" to little-known "League of Nations" novels.
