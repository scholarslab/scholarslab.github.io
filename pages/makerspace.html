    <div class="maker-vision__text">
      <p>The Scholars&rsquo; Lab Makerspace is strategically situated within the UVA
        Library to be open, provide a low barrier of entry to making, and be a helpful
        resource of information, technology and support. The space invites all
        people, and proactively encourages those in underrepresented academic
        studies, ethnicities, genders, economic classes and skill levels to come,
        learn, make, and be empowered to improve their education, research, and
        community. The Makerspace is an active participant in academic research
        through independent and collaborative work with scholars to explore,
        understand, and report on emerging technologies, methodologies and
        pedagogies in a variety of disciplines.

    <div class="maker-mission__text">
      <p>All humans are dreamers, creators, and achievers. Our mission is to

      <p>The Makerspace is open to all UVA students, staff and faculty, 
        regardless of department, major, academic or personal interests, 
        or any other characteristic. We hope you will find the equipment, 
        resources and support to help you MAKE anything (within reason) 
        you want to make.</p>
        <p>You can stop in any time during our open hours, or contact us at <a
           href="mailto:slabmakerspace@virginia.edu">slabmakerspace@virginia.edu</a>
        to schedule an appointment with a Makerspace Technologist or
        Scholars&rsquo; Lab staff to discuss your project.</p>
        <p>We love working with faculty to support class projects! Send your requests 
          and ideas to our Makerspace Manager, Ammon Shepherd, at 
          <a href="mailto:ammon@virginia.edu">ammon@virginia.edu</a></p>

        <p>Use the <a id="equipment-btn" href="https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/equipment?lid=264">Library
          Equipment Reservation site</a> to reserve equipment.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Textiles</h3>
      <p>We have two Bernina 350 Series sewing machines and a Juki MO-644D serger available for reservation or walk-in use.</p>

      <h3>3D Printing</h3>
      <p>We have four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication">FFF</a> style printers and one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography">Resin (SLA)</a> printer available for reservation. To use the printers, you can come in during open hours for in-person training and on-the-spot reservation. In order to reserve printers for future use, you will need to complete an on-line certification. The on-line certification is forthcoming, so the only way to use the 3D printers for now is to come in during open hours and speak with a Technologist to reserve a printer after in-person training.</p>
      
      <p>3D printing is still available through the <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/3d-printing/">3D Printing Studio</a> in the Robertson Media Center in Clemons Library. To use the printers there, you need to complete an <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/3d-printing/">online training</a>, then reserve a 3D printer during their <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">open hours</a>. Email <a href="mailto:teachlearn@virginia.edu">teachlearn@virginia.edu</a> with any questions. </p>
      
      <p>The 3D printers are completely different from each other in each space, so training on 3D Printing Studio printers does not automatically grant access to the Makerspace printers, although the on-line training is similar.</p>

      <h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
      <p>Our laser cutter is not yet available. We'll update this page as soon as installation and training process is complete.</p>
      <!-- <p>We have a Universal VLS 6.75 laser cutter available for reservation. To use the laser cutter, you must <a href="https://youtu.be/2fp6pSZoJ9Q?feature=shared&t=85">watch this video</a> to learn the process of using a laser cutter. (We use the same laser cutter as the A School Fablab, but watching the) After watching the video, you will receive an in-person training before you can reserve and use the laser cutter.</p> -->
