      <p>The Scholars&#8217; Lab Makerspace is a place for crafting, tinkering,
      and experimentation with technologies like 3D printing, sewing, physical
      computing, and augmented reality. <strong>Open to
          everyone</strong>&mdash;absolutely no prior experience needed and no
      fees!&mdash;we specialize in hands-on approaches to research questions in
      the humanities and arts.</p>
      <p>Informed by a rich tradition of Library support for exploring
      materiality in <a href="http://smallnotes.library.virginia.edu/">Special
      Collections</a> and the Fine Arts Library <a
  href="http://uvamagazine.org/articles/the_tactile_library">Materials
  Collection</a>, and for participating in the physical-made-digital in both
  the <a href="http://scholarslab.org/">Scholars&#8217; Lab</a> and the <a
  href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours#robertson-media-center">Robertson
  Media Center</a> in Clemons, our Makerspace Technologists can help faculty
  and student researchers evaluate new approaches to their work, and consider
  both the hows and the whys of making.</p> <p>Learning <i>how</i> to do
  something with humanities technology gives us a more informed perspective on
  <i>why</i> we do things in the humanities. <strong>Both are
  vital.</strong></p>

        <h3>3D Printer Rules of Use</h3>
        <p>You must schedule a printer and your print must be approved in
        advance of printing. By making a reservation, you agree to the
            following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Items that may not be printed include but are not limited
                to: models which are defective or unsuited for FDM printing,
                models of weapons and their accessories, copyrighted materials,
                or items designed for mass production and/or commercial use.
                Staff technologists reserve the right to cancel or refuse a
                print at any time.</li>

                <li>Unscheduled printers can be reserved by walk-ins on a
                first-come first-served basis.</li>

                <li>If you do not arrive within 15 minutes of the start of your
                of reservation, you may lose your print time.</li>

                <li>You must regularly monitor your print, and be available to
                remove it before the Makerspace closes.  Prints cannot run
                outside of staffed hours.</li>

                <li>Makerspace printers are intended for educational and
                experimentation purposes. Priority will be given to the UVA
                community users. Printing is currently free, but the staff
                reserves the right to ask users to supply their own filament
                for ongoing or large jobs.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>If you have any questions, please do ask us! We enjoy helping folks figure out how to use our Makerspace.</p>
