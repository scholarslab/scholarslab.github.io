One of our primary missions is to support the work of emerging scholars and digital humanities practitioners--particularly UVa graduate students. In addition to our general consultations (grad students are invited to [write us](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) for an appointment any time!), we offer three graduate fellowship programs that provide students with the time, space, and mentorship necessary to discover, explore, and build. We also offer a number of opportunities for students to gain training and experience as digital humanists. Check out our offerings below and get in touch if you have questions.

For expressions of the pedagogy we bring to our work with students, explore our [student programs charter](/student-programs-charter/), the <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/praxis-program-charter">Praxis Program charter</a>, and the [general Scholars' Lab charter](/charter/). To see the results of some of these collaborations, check out our [archive of student projects](/student-projects-archive).
