The University of Virginia Library has the unique opportunity and expertise to acquire data of sites and objects in and around the Academical Village. Opportunities afforded to the Library include collaborative projects to scan and 3D print artifacts with the Fralin Museum and University Library Special Collections and to 3D scan historic sites such as Montpelier, Monticello and the Academical Village.  Each semester students are invited to train with Library experts on advanced documentation technologies that will quite likely enable them to transform their professional field.

The following are some of the skills that will be taught:

* terrestrial laser scanning of buildings, monuments and environments
* high resolution laser scanning of artifacts and cultural objects
* photogrammetric techniques using ground based cameras or aerial drones
* understanding the principles of 3D data collected from 3D scanning
* processing software for making 3D data functional and relevant for scholarly use
* incorporating 3D data into architectural software and workflows
* incorporating architectural assets with the latest VR and AR technologies
* refining 3D data for 3D printing
* motion capture of culturally or ritually significant movement
* connections to professionals on and off Grounds, locally and regionally

Prospective students will work directly with Will Rourk (ARCH and ARH) and Arin Bennett at the University Library and receive 3 credits for a completed semester.  Will and Arin have over 6 years of experience in cultural heritage documentation and have worked extensively with University faculty, students and staff toward the scholarly use of cultural heritage data.  Interns will gain professional grade knowledge while receiving credit towards their degree including credit for the Certificate in Historic Preservation.  An example of cultural heritage informatics at the Library can be found [here](http://bit.ly/UVA3D).

Please contact Will Rourk if you have any questions regarding Cultural Heritage Informatics at [will@virginia.edu](mailto:will@virginia.edu).
