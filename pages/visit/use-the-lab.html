<h2>Welcome! We are glad you are here</h2>
<p>The Scholars’ Lab is a gathering place—and a tech-enabled workspace for learning, exploration, and practice of digital scholarship.</p>

<p>As a research center, we invite students, faculty, and community scholars who wish to ask new questions with and of technology, or to push disciplinary and methodological boundaries through new approaches.</p>

<h2>Hours + Location Map</h2>

<h3>Hours</h3>
<p>Unless reserved for a special event, the Scholars’ Lab public spaces are open whenever Shannon Library is open; Scholars' Lab's Makerspace is open for a subset of those hours that varies by term:</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>Planning a trip to the Lab? Contacting us at <a href="mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu">scholarslab@virginia.edu</a> to arrange a time to meet is the recommended way to make sure the staffer with the skillset you need will be there when you visit. During most of our <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/events">public events</a>, the Lab remains open for silent individual study, but it will be noisier than usual and seating will be prioritized for event attendees. Infrequently, we host private events and classes, and we may ask you to move to another part of the Library.</p>

<p>For more information about our space and what it has to offer, see <a href="/use-the-lab#use-of-slab-spaces">Use of Scholars' Lab Spaces</a>.</p>

<h3>Location Map</h3>
<p>The Scholars' Lab is located in the University of Virginia's Edgar Shannon Library (formerly Alderman), covering the 3rd floor east wing. The University provides an <a href="https://www.fm.virginia.edu/docs/ges/ADA_Regions_CentralGrounds.pdf">accessibility map</a> that includes accessible routes and parking to the Shannon Library building.</p>

<p>From the Memorial Hall entrance (4th floor), we're one flight down. From the new McCormick Road entrance (2nd floor), we're one floor up. The UVA Library provides <a href="https://library.virginia.edu/maps">directions to the building</a>, including a <a href="https://library.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/2024-01/Building_Guide.pdf">guide to the new Shannon building</a>.</p>

possible references to COVID precautions
maps
directions from nearest accessible parking and elevators
directions to nearest gendered/gender-neutral/family restrooms

physical accessibility of spaces
variance of noise level of spaces
if some of these already exist on other library-wide public pages we could link to those?

<h2>Physical accessbility</h2>

<h3>Illness</h3>
<p><a href="https://uvamagazine.org/articles/uva_drops_mandates_for_vaccines_indoor_masking">UVA does not currently require in classrooms or public spaces</a>, though these recomain recommended as an effective precautionary measure against spreading COVID-19, colds, flus, and other illnesses that can range from inconvenient to disabling or worse, especially for colleagues who are immunocompromised.</p>

<p>You can be contagious and not have any symptoms; home COVID tests are not 100% accurate. Please keep this in mind when we share space together. If you are feeling ill, we ask that you not attend events in our space; please [contact us](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) to request virtual consultation or event attendance options.</p>

<p>We have extra masks available for attendees of events in our space who want one.</p>

<h3>Mobility & distance</h3>
<p>Directions on accessing our space from the nearest parking and elevators; gendered, gender-neutral, and family restrooms; lactation room; as well as any intervening barriers to physical access, will appear on our <a href="/use-the-lab">"Use the Lab" page</a> soon.</p>

<p>Our new makerspace room (Shannon 308i) was designed with physical access in mind, and includes options like worktables that can be raised and lowered to wheelchair sitting and standing heights. Please contact <a href="/people/ammon-shepherd">Makerspace Manager Ammon Shepherd</a> if you have questions about physical makerspace access.</p>
