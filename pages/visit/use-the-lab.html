<h2>Welcome! We are glad you are here.</h2>
<p>The Scholars’ Lab is a gathering place—and a tech-enabled workspace for learning, exploration, and practice of digital scholarship.</p>

<p>As a research center, we invite students, faculty, and community scholars who wish to ask new questions with and of technology, or to push disciplinary and methodological boundaries through new approaches.</p>

<h2>Hours + Location Map</h2>

<h3>Hours</h3>
<p>Unless reserved for a special event, the Scholars’ Lab public spaces are open whenever Shannon Library is open; Scholars' Lab's Makerspace is open for a subset of those hours that varies by term:</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>Planning a trip to the Lab? Contacting us at <a href="mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu">scholarslab@virginia.edu</a> to arrange a time to meet is the recommended way to make sure the staffer with the skillset you need will be there when you visit. During most of our <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/events">public events</a>, the Lab remains open for silent individual study, but it will be noisier than usual and seating will be prioritized for event attendees. Infrequently, we host private events and classes, and we may ask you to move to another part of the Library.</p>

<p>For more information about our space and what it has to offer, see <a href="/use-the-lab#use-of-slab-spaces">Use of Scholars' Lab Spaces</a>.</p>

<h3>Location Map</h3>
<p>The Scholars' Lab is located in the University of Virginia's Edgar Shannon Library (formerly Alderman), covering the 3rd floor east wing. The University provides an <a href="https://www.fm.virginia.edu/docs/ges/ADA_Regions_CentralGrounds.pdf">accessibility map</a> that includes accessible routes and parking to the Shannon Library building.</p>

<p>From the Memorial Hall entrance (4th floor), we're one flight down. From the new McCormick Road entrance (2nd floor), we're one floor up. The UVA Library provides <a href="https://library.virginia.edu/maps">directions to the building</a>, including a <a href="https://library.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/2024-01/Building_Guide.pdf">guide to the new Shannon building</a>.</p>

<h3>Use of Scholars' Lab Spaces</h3>
<p>The Scholars’ Lab public space supports a number of activities, including digital project presentations, collaborative project development, speaker events, workshops, technology demonstrations, instruction sessions, and interest groups./<p>

<p>Reservations for the presentation and VR spaces are available by appointment, with prior approval of Scholars’ Lab staff. If you have use requests or special event proposals, please send them to <a href="mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu">scholarslab@virginia.edu</a>. Spaces may not be reserved for regular (semester-long) courses, student meetings, or group study.</p>


<span id="CR-cal"><h4>Scholars' Lab Common Room Availability</h4></span>
<p>The Scholars' Lab Common Room (Shannon 308) is a vibrant and community-focused space dedicated to supporting digital scholarship. To do that, we host a variety of different types of events and classes.</p>

<p>That means that sometimes the Common Room may not be open for general study. We will do our best to indicate what that means for you.  Occasionally, we will need to close (i.e. no computer/equipment use, no study space, no traffic) for uses such as digital scholarship-focused classes and other private events. More often, our space will be open; there will be access to the computers, but we will have a noisy environment (e.g. a public event taking place) and/or certain areas may be off-limits (e.g. a class is being taught using the computers or VR space). We will post signs outside both entrances to indicate any use changes or restrictions whenever the space is reserved for special events.</p>

<p>If you want to be sure the room and equipment will be available when you visit, please check our digital calendars—either at our front door or below. These display all times the Common Room is reserved for private or semi-private events. For more information about our spaces, please contact <a href="mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu">ScholarsLab@Virginia.edu</a>.</p>

possible references to COVID precautions
maps
directions from nearest accessible parking and elevators
directions to nearest gendered/gender-neutral/family restrooms
directions to lactation room
physical accessibility of spaces
variance of noise level of spaces
if some of these already exist on other library-wide public pages we could link to those?

<h2>Physical accessbility</h2>

<h3>Illness</h3>
<p><a href="https://uvamagazine.org/articles/uva_drops_mandates_for_vaccines_indoor_masking">UVA does not currently require in classrooms or public spaces</a>, though these recomain recommended as an effective precautionary measure against spreading COVID-19, colds, flus, and other illnesses that can range from inconvenient to disabling or worse, especially for colleagues who are immunocompromised.</p>

<p>You can be contagious and not have any symptoms; home COVID tests are not 100% accurate. Please keep this in mind when we share space together. If you are feeling ill, we ask that you not attend events in our space; please [contact us](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) to request virtual consultation or event attendance options.</p>

<p>We have extra masks available for attendees of events in our space who want one.</p>

<h3>Mobility & distance</h3>
<p>Directions on accessing our space from the nearest parking and elevators; gendered, gender-neutral, and family restrooms; lactation room; as well as any intervening barriers to physical access, will appear on our <a href="/use-the-lab">"Use the Lab" page</a> soon.</p>

<p>Our new makerspace room (Shannon 308i) was designed with physical access in mind, and includes options like worktables that can be raised and lowered to wheelchair sitting and standing heights. Please contact <a href="/people/ammon-shepherd">Makerspace Manager Ammon Shepherd</a> if you have questions about physical makerspace access.</p>
