<section id="mission">
	<h2>Mission + Vision</h2>
	<p>All humans are dreamers, creators, and achievers. Our mission is to provide the place, the tools, and the support to empower people to dream, create and achieve. The Scholars' Lab Makerspace is strategically situated within the UVA Library to be open, provide a low barrier of entry to making, and be a helpful resource of information, technology and support. Our space is open to everyone, including the public, and proactively encourages those in underrepresented academic studies, ethnicities, genders, economic classes and skill levels to come learn, make, and research.</p>
    <p>The Makerspace staff provides consultations and instruction for all your electronics, crafting, textiles, laser cutting, and 3D printing projects <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours/">whenever the Makerspace is open</a>, or by appointment. Please drop in, or send inquiries to <a href="mailto:slabmakerspace@virginia.edu">slabmakerspace@virginia.edu</a>.</p>
	<p>Or schedule a consultation with Ammon, manager of our Makerspace.</p>

	<h2>Makerspace Resources</h2>
	<h3>Using the Makerspace</h3>
	<p>The Makerspace is open to all UVA students, staff and faculty, as well as the general public. We hope you will find the equipment, resources, and support to help you MAKE anything (within reason) you want to make.</p>
	<p>You can stop in any time during our open hours, or contact us at <a href="mailto:slabmakerspace@virginia.edu">slabmakerspace@virginia.edu</a> to schedule an appointment with a Makerspace Technologist or Scholars&rsquo; Lab staff to discuss your project.</p>
	<p>You can view a list of all of our resources at this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hYBB9AKs475Qp5-jCX1tZ5sgtdWe_IbUSi-KLwTc_wo/edit?gid=0#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
	<h3>Equipment</h3>
	<p>All equipment can be reserved for use in the Makerspace by visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/reserve/Makerspace-Equipment">the equipment page</a>.</p>
	<p>You can also reserve equipment when you visit the Makerspace in person. Each tool has a QR code to scan for reservation.</p>
	<p>All equipment is intended to use in the Makerspace and is not available for check out at this time. Don't see the equipment you need here? Visit <a href="http://makergrounds.virginia.edu">makergrounds.virginia.edu</a> for other shops, labs, and places for making at UVA.</p>

<div id="buttons" class="equipment_block">
	<h3>Buttons</h3>
	<p>We have two different sized button makers; 1.5-inch and 2.25-inch. <strong>Button supplies provided by the Makerspace are intended for individual, personal use.</strong> Due to the popularity and cost of button supplies, there is a 12 button per person per semester limit.</p>
	<p>Clubs and other organizations who would like to make more than 12 buttons can purchase their own supplies and use our button presses. The <a href="https://www.buttonmakers.net/225buttons">2.25-inch button kit</a> from <a href="https://buttonmakers.net">ButtonMakers.net</a> is the recommended option.</p>

<div id="printers" class="equipment_block">
	<h3>3D Printing</h3>
	<p>We have five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication">FFF</a> style printers and one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography">Resin (SLA)</a> printer available for reservation. To use the printers, you can come in during open hours for in-person training and on-the-spot reservation.</p>
	<p>Reserving a printer outside of open hours requires approval of a Makerspace Technologist. Speak with the Technologist on duty to extend your time outside of open hours.</p>
	<p>In order to reserve the FFF printers before coming to the Makerspace, you will need to complete an on-line certification.</p>
	
	<a id="3d-printer-certification" class="makerspace-button" href="https://virginia.libwizard.com/f/3D_printer_certification">3D Printer Certification</a>

	<p>Resin printer certification is forthcoming.</p>

	<p>Self-service 3D printing is also available through the <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/3d-printing/">3D Printing Studio</a> in the Robertson Media Center in Clemons Library. To use the printers there, you need to complete an <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/3d-printing/">online training</a>, then reserve a 3D printer during their <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">open hours</a>. Email <a href="mailto:teachlearn@virginia.edu">teachlearn@virginia.edu</a> with any questions.</p>
 	<p>The 3D printers are completely different from each other in each space, so training on 3D Printing Studio printers does not automatically grant access to the Makerspace printers.</p>
