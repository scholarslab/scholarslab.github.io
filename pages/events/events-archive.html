<!-- Below code pulls in events from Spring 2025, stored in '_includes/_content-includes/_past-events/2025-events' as single .md files per term due to the 1/1/2025 shift to LibCal event management. Includes have to go in the includes folder, is why I didn't store these in the 'collections/events' folder. Capture & markdownify code below allows us to manage the file as markdown (easier to add to list), but display within this HTML page as HTML. See section comment below this section, for pre-2025 event pull+display. And have a nice day :) -->
