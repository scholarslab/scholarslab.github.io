<!-- could use expansion to everything we offer faculty, e.g. better description of and links to FRS/CEGs; course design and co-teaching we do, maybe with some examples of such past work? also we might add a sentence or two directing faculty to other, not-limited-to-faculty offerings such as consultations, makerspace, events? -->

We frequently work with UVA faculty, and are especially interested in assisting:
* Faculty who don't do digital work, but are curious to learn more
* Faculty wishing to become digital scholars & methodological practitioners in their own right
* Existing digital scholars looking for advising, accomplices, or collaborators

Opportunities with Scholars' Lab include:  
* Calls like the [2025 Data Analytics Center-Digital Humanities Center Fellowship](/blog/hpc-fellowships-cfp/), pairing teams of 1 UVA faculty member and 1 UVA graduate student on experimental humanities research requiring high-performance computing resources  
* Consultations, scheduled by [emailing us](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu)
* Pedagogical collaboration (e.g. syllabi collaboration to add a DH component to a course; co-teaching by staff)
* Public space for showcasing data art and visualizations
* Connection to our international scholarly network for conferences, collaborators, job searches, scholarly communication and amplification, and other opportunities 
* DHSI tuition waivers (limited number each year, by application announced on blog)
* SLab staff partnership with other expert Library colleagues on the Library's Course Enrichment Grants and Faculty Research Sprints
* For faculty considering applying to other roles with some digital scholarship inflection, [our professional development opportunities](/professional-development)
