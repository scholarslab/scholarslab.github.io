We hope to update this page to reflect current and recent website work soon! In summary, we've migrated the site from WordPress to a Jekyll-generated static site.

Until we write a more detailed description of this site, you may be interested in the colophon information for the previous version of this website:

The Scholars' Lab site is written and maintained collaboratively by our staff, graduate fellows, and visiting scholars. We use an up-to-date version of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) to run the site. Our site theme, Labnotes, is developed in-house and is tailored specifically for our needs, but the code is freely available in our [Github repository](http://github.com/scholarslab/labnotes). The development of the theme involves several tools:



	
  * We use the latest and greatest [HTML 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) for page structure. Our HTML 5 template is a slightly modified version of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/).

	
  * We use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for presentation. The CSS for this site was developed with a CSS pre-processor called [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). We also use [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), a CSS authoring framework built on Sass, and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/), a CSS grid framework also built on Sass.

	
  * We use several JavaScript libraries and frameworks, all of which are called from the [MaxCDN](http://www.maxcdn.com/) content delivery network:

	
    * [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) for browser feature detection;

	
    * [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) to help some older browsers use media queries for responsive design;

	
    * [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com/) to help older versions of Internet Explorer recognize CSS pseudo-classes and attribute selectors;

	
    * [Responsive Nav](http://responsive-nav.com/) to help make our main navigation responsive and mobile-friendly;

	
    * [Headroom](http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js/) to help hide and show our site's header when scrolling.




	
  * The fonts used throughout the site are [Source Sans Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Source Code Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts).

	
  * Our background image is [Chalkboard](http://thepatternlibrary.com/#chalkboard) by Claudio Guglieri.

	
  * Most of our header images were taken by, and are copyright, [Shane Lin](/people/shane-lin/).


We also depend on a number of WordPress plugins, including:
