For the next and final round of the [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) plugin release parade, I’m pleased to announce minor or patch releases for all [Neatline](http://neatline.org/) plugins. Neatline is an [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) plugin that helps you tell stories in time and space from your Omeka collection. For more information, see our [original announcement](http://www.scholarslab.org/announcements/announcing-neatline/) or the [Neatline site](http://neatline.org/).




For now, these are maintenance releases that patch up bugs and improve performance. Stay tuned over the course of the next couple months, though, for news about some exciting new directions for Neatline. We're hard at work on a new round of development that's going to migrate Neatline over to Omeka 2.0, make it a lot easier to use Neatline in a multi-user classroom environment, and make it possible to connect paragraphs, sentences, and words in TEI texts to specific locations in Neatline exhibits.





Here’s some information about the bug-fix releases.
