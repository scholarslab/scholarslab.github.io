### Applications of the Music Encoding Initiative in Optical Music Recognition


On April 20th, the Scholars' Lab welcomed visiting scholar Andrew Hankinson, a PhD candidate in the Distributed Digital Music Archives and Libraries Lab at the Schulich School of Music at McGill University.

Mr. Hankinson's talk introduced work at the Distributed Digital Music Archives and Libraries Lab on creating optical music recognition systems for recognizing printed music books, specifically focusing on the use of MEI to encode and preserve musical works. Hankinson also presented applications in notation data analysis, searching, and discovery of printed music works.
