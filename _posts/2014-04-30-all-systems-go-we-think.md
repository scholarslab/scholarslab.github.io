Yesterday at 1PM we launched Ivanhoe 1.0. We are excited about our progress and hope you can take some time to [download ](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/)the theme to your own WordPress accounts. We have made [documentation](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/documentation.html) readily available for those new to Ivanhoe and we hope users will add to this space ([via GitHub](https://github.com/scholarslab/ivanhoe/issues?state=open)) so that we can continue to create a better product. As I reflect back on the last year I wanted to share a few things....

**My favorite moment:** playing Apples-to-Apples during a holiday get together. I feel like the experience bonded our team in a cool way and renewed my enthusiasm for integrating games at work. One can never predict the unexpected outcomes of play.

**What I learned about myself: **[I can't do it all](http://www.scholarslab.org/grad-student-research/when-expectations-meet-reality/), but that's ok... especially when you have a team of amazing people ready to step in and help you out.

**How I would integrate Ivanhoe into the classroom:** A theoretical concept in Media Studies (among other disciplines) is the idea of "[intertextuality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality)" - or how we make meaning of one type of media (a text, movie, television show, etc) based on our already existing knowledge of another form of media. I created a game in Ivanhoe using this concept. I uploaded a film from YouTube and inserted the following directions:

_1. Watch one of the videos (original or move) available on the game._

_2. Create a role based on the video you watched._

_3. Make a move (or respond to a move) by inserting in another video from YouTube (preferably under 3 minutes) whose meaning is tied to your role AND the video you watched. Use the rationale section to justify the connection. _

_4. The game ends when no more connections can be made._

I look forward to seeing how others incorporate the tool and the games users end up concocting along the way....
