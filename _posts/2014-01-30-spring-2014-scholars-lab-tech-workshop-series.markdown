We're pleased to announce our Spring 2014 Tech Workshop series roster.

All workshop sessions are free, open to the public, and require neither previous experience nor registration.

**February 12**
_**Introduction to Neatline**_
Join us for a hands-on introduction to Neatline, a set of plugins for Omeka developed by the Scholars’ Lab. With Neatline, anyone can create beautiful, complex maps and narrative sequences from collections of archives and artifacts, and connect maps and narratives with timelines that are more-than-usually sensitive to ambiguity and nuance. See [neatline.org](http://neatline.org/) for more information.

**Time:** 3:00-4:00pm
**Location:** Alderman Library Electronic Classroom (ALD 421)
**Instructor:** Ronda Grizzle
  


**February 26**
**_Neatline Timelines_**
You say you’ve got the basics of the tools available in Neatline, but want to know more about how to use timelines to illustrate your data? This is the class for you. Please join us for this 1-hour, hands-on workshop. Prior experience with Neatline or previous attendance at the Introduction to Neatline workshop is helpful, but not required.

**Time:** 3:00-4:00pm
**Location:** Alderman Library Electronic Classroom (ALD 421)
**Instructor:** Ronda Grizzle
  


**March 5**
**_Introduction to Screen Scraping_**
Have you ever found data on the web that you need to use, but when you look for the “download” button, it’s not there? If so, we can help you. In this workshop, we’ll start with a quick introduction to Python. We’ll also talk about several libraries that are commonly used to download pages and pull information out of them. And by the end of the session, we’ll have downloaded a web page and extracted data from it into a format that we can easily load into Excel, a database, or a statistical package.

**Time:** 1:00-2:00pm
**Location:** Alderman Library Electronic Classroom (ALD 421)
**Instructor:** Eric Rochester
  


**March 19**
**_Version Control with git_**
If you have trouble keeping track of changes you’ve made in projects, then git can help you. It’s a *version control* program that remembers all the changes you’ve make to a project, and it also helps you collaborate with others on that project. Git’s great for managing websites, computer program source code, and even papers. In this workshop, we’ll learn about how git views the world so that we can use it more effectively, and we’ll get hands-on practice using git to track changes in a small project.

**Time:** 3:00-4:00pm
**Location:** Alderman Library Electronic Classroom (ALD 421)
**Instructor:** Eric Rochester
  


**March 26**
**_Web Site Design and Development_**
This workshop will help demystify the process of creating a web site by introducing some basic concepts and methods for web site design and development. By the end of the workshop, students will understand rudimentary HTML for web page markup and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for web site presentation and design. Students should walk away from the class with a simple but tasteful “About Me” page they can publish to the web, and use as a foundation for building a larger web site. Comfort with a computer and web browser will make the workshop easier; prior experience with web design or development could be useful, but is not required.

**Time:** 3:00-4:00pm
**Location:** Alderman Library Electronic Classroom (ALD 421)
**Instructor:** Jeremy Boggs
