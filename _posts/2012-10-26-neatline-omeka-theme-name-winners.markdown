After extensive deliberations at the Scholars' Lab, we're pleased to announce that we have two winners of the Neatline Omeka Theme Name Contest:Amanda Visconti and the theme name "Astrolabe," and Franky Abbott with the theme name "Neatscape." We'll be getting in touch with Amanda and Franky separately, to get those beautiful Neatline tshirts their way. This means we'll develop and release **two** Omeka themes. (I'll have my work cut out for me, but it's wonderful work.) We'll make those themes compatible with the upcoming 2.0 version of Omeka, so look for those themes shortly after Omeka 2.0 is released!
