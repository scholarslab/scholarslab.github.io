**Kathleen Fitzpatrick**
**Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy**

Dr. Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Director of Scholarly Communication for the Modern Language Association, joined us in the Scholars' Lab on March 15, 2012 for a talk as part of our spring speaker series.

Dr. Siva Vaidhyanathan, Robertson Professor in Media Studies and Chair of the Department of Media Studies at U.Va., served as the initial respondent for this talk.

Abstract:
"What if the academic monograph is a dying form? If scholarly communication is to have a future, it’s clear that it lies online, and yet the most significant obstacles to such a transformation are social and institutional. How must the academy and the scholars that comprise it change their ways of thinking in order for digital scholarly publishing to become a viable alternative? This talk will explore some of those changes and their implications for our lives as scholars and our work within universities."
