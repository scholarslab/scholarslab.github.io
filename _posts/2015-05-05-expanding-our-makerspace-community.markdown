_Are you a UVA graduate student or upper-level undergraduate in the humanities?  Interested working in our Makerspace?_

[![Partially assembled Sparkfun Inventor's Kit, with an Arduino board, breadboard, and soldering iron](http://scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/makerspace7-300x200.jpg)](http://scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/makerspace7.jpg)Our Makerspace is designed to foster experimentation with 3D modeling and printing, physical computing (e.g. Arduino, wearables) and more.  We are seeking part-time student consultants to help maintain the public space, field users’ basic maker and general computing questions, and connect researchers to Scholars’ Lab staff when necessary.  When not actively engaged with users, students will be asked to experiment with the equipment, to pursue their own research, and to publish their processes and observations on the Scholars’ Lab blog. They will also be expected to conduct informal workshops to train new users.

Experience with 3D modeling and printing, electronics, sewing, and/or programming preferred, but can be learned on the job.  The successful candidate will be able to work up to 10 hours per week.

An important aspect of the maker culture is apprenticeship and supporting makers in their pursuit of professional experience. We are looking for motivated individuals who are capable of working independently and value the opportunity to engage with and support a growing community.  Benefits of the job may include: access to expertise and mentoring in your field of interest, use of equipment and tools, and ability to shape Scholars’ Lab workshops and programming.

Candidates should include a cover letter discussing their interest in working in the Scholars’ Lab, detailing any experience or interest in participating in a maker space, and outlining any previous experience with public service or assisting others in using technology.
