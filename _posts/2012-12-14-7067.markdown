The last couple of weeks have seen a great deal of news and conversation about graduate education reform. I have a lot to say about it (unsurprisingly!); you can [find my take on it over at ProfHacker](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/graduate-education-reform/45043). The piece includes some discussion of SCI's latest work, the Praxis Program, and the budding Praxis Network, so I hope you’ll take a look!

I’m also happy to note that I’ll be talking more about all of this at the upcoming MLA Convention in Boston—if you’re interested the topic, consider attending [this roundtable on Rebooting Graduate Training](http://www.mla.org/program_details?prog_id=749&year=2013). There will be ample time for discussion at the session, so come ready with questions and ideas.
