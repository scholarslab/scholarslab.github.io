**_What do you get when you cross archives and artifacts with timelines, modern and historical maps, and an appreciation for the interpretive aims of humanities scholarship?_**

[![](http://www.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-shot-2012-07-02-at-10.36.28-AM1.png)](http://www.neatline.org/)

Today, the [Scholars' Lab](http://scholarslab.org) is proud to announce the launch of [Neatline](http://neatline.org/), our set of [Omeka](http://omeka.org) plugins for hand-crafted geo-temporal visualization and interpretation. You can head right over to [http://neatline.org/](http://neatline.org/) to download the [1.0 software](http://neatline.org/plugins/), see [sample exhibits](http://neatline.org/neatline-in-action/) or play in the [sandbox](http://sandbox.neatline.org/), and read more [about the project](http://neatline.org/about/), including [news](http://neatline.org/news/) and [history](http://neatline.org/about/credits-and-history/).

[Neatline](http://neatline.org/) is a geotemporal exhibit-builder that allows you to create beautiful, complex maps and narrative sequences from collections of archives and artifacts, and to connect your maps and narratives with timelines that are more-than-usually sensitive to ambiguity and nuance. In other words, Neatline lets you make hand-crafted, interactive stories as interpretive expressions of an archival or cultural heritage collection.

Every Neatline exhibit can be your own close reading of a humanities collection -- expressed in the visual vernacular.  Ours is a small-data approach in a "big data" world.

Stay tuned to the [Scholars' Lab blog](http://scholarslab.org/) and to [Neatline.org](http://neatline.org/) for a series of posts and screencasts to be shared over the course of the next two weeks. We'll be providing support for this [open-source software](https://github.com/scholarslab/) on the [Omeka forums](http://omeka.org/forums/) and [dev list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/omeka-dev).
