**Introduction to Omeka
Wednesday, January 28**
_10:00 am–11:30 am · Alderman Library, Room 421_
[ ![omekalogo_sm](http://scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/omekalogo_sm-110x110.jpg)Omeka](http://omeka.org) is a simple, free, web publishing system developed at the [Roy Rosensweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/) at George Mason University. It was specifically built to enable scholars, archives, libraries, museums, and independent researchers to create online exhibits of their work without having to know HTML or CSS. If you have a collections of digital resources that you want to show in a scholarly way, Omeka could be a great tool to have in your toolkit.
