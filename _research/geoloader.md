Geoloader is a suite of command-line tools that interact with the REST services of Geoserver and Geonetwork to make adding new media and metadata simple. Used in conjunction with Geoportal, this tools helps manage the flow of data to the discovery interface with support for Redis-based queing, constructing Solr indexes from ISO 19139-conformant metadata.

This tool is available at [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/geoloader) and the source code on our [Github](https://github.com/scholarslab/Geoloader) page.
