[The Mind is a Metaphor](http://metaphors.lib.virginia.edu) site is a collaboration with [Brad Pasanek](http://www.engl.virginia.edu/faculty/pasanek_brad.shtml). The project collects "metaphors and root-images appealed to by the novelists, poets, dramatists, essayists, philosophers, belle-lettrists, preachers, and pamphleteers of the long eighteenth century."

The project took an existing database that was being manually edited through phpMyAdmin and reimagining it as a Ruby on Rails application with the primary search and browsing interfaces being provided through Solr and its faceting interface. By providing a faceted interface for the metaphors, researchers can quickly narrow search categories to quickly find examples of metaphors in specific literary periods, metaphor categories, genres, nationalities, political leanings of authors, religious views, as well as the gender of the writer.
