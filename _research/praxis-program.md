The Praxis Program is a 2011–13 pilot project of the [Scholars' Lab](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab) in collaboration with the [Scholarly Communication Institute](http://uvasci.org). The Praxis Program funds two groups of six University of Virginia graduate students from a variety of disciplines to apprentice with us for an academic year as we conceptualize, design, and build a digital tool for humanities interpretation.

It’s a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer, and is is meant to complement our work with [Graduate Fellows in Digital Humanities](http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/about/fellowship.html), a program now in its fifth year at UVa Library. Recognizing that up-to-date methodological training is often absent or catch-as-catch-can for humanities graduate students, we are using two pilot years of the Praxis Program to experiment with an action-oriented curriculum _live and in public._ We hope to attract partners in labs and centers at other institutions as well as local supporters, and to situate our contribution in a larger conversation about the changing demands of the humanities in a digital age.

Praxis hopes to equip knowledge workers for emerging faculty positions and [alternative academic careers](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac) at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. We'll share our evolving curriculum and our staff and students alike will be [blogging about their experience](http://www.scholarslab.org/category/praxisprogram/).

We invite you to watch as we see what it takes to produce thoughtful DH scholars who are comfortable designing effective user experiences, writing and working with open source code, engaging broad audiences, managing teams and budgets, and theorizing their work within the rich tradition of humanities computing.
